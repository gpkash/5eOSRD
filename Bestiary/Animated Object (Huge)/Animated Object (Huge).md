**Animated**. If the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form. The DM might rule that a specific objects slam attack inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

##### Actions
**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
