Members of the Transcendent Order train to act without thinking, eliminating thought behind action. Conduits react with the cadence of the multiverse. Their sharp reflexes border on precognition, allowing them to unconsciously act before their foes.

**Instinctive Reflexes**. The conduit has advantage on initiative rolls, and it can't have disadvantage on attack rolls.

**Unarmored Defense**. While the conduit is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

#### Reactions
**Deflect Attack**. In response to being hit by an attack roll, the conduit partially deflects the blow. The damage the conduit takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10.

**Don't Be There**. When the conduit must make a saving throw, it can move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If its new position moves it out of range or otherwise makes it impossible to be targeted by the effect, the conduit avoids the effect entirely.
