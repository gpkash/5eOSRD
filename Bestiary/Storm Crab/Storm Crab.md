### Storm Crab
_Gargantuan monstrosity, unaligned_

![[Storm Crab.webp]]

Storm crabs are colossal crustaceans with four monstrous claws and a poisonous stinger. Equally adept underwater or on shore, they can exhale a jet of pressurized water to crush foes.

Giants on some worlds claim Stronmaus or one of his children created storm crabs in the early years of an ancient empire. Just as behirs were created to fight dragons on land and rocs to challenge dragons' mastery of the sky, storm crabs were meant to battle dragon turtles, bronze dragons, and other aquatic foes. On many worlds, these creatures fiercely guard the underwater strongholds of storm giants, as well as the ruined keeps giants have abandoned.

**Amphibious**. The crab can breathe air and water.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The crab makes two Claw attacks and one Stinger attack.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16). The crab has four claws, each of which can grapple one target.

**Stinger**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] and [[paralyzed]] conditions for 1 minute. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending both the [[poisoned]] and [[paralyzed]] conditions on itself on a success.

**Water Jet Recharge 5-6**. The crab exhales water in a 150-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage, is pushed up to 30 feet from the crab, and has the [[prone]] condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
