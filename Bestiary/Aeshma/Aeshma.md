### Aeshma
_Medium humanoid (tiefling), chaotic neutral_

![[Aeshma.jpg]]

Aeshma is a tiefling who was born into a rich and affluent family with ties to powerful families within the city of Waterdeep. Aeshma has learned that everything in life comes easy, free, and without consequence. Aeshma is a jack of no trades and master of none, he has ceremoniously failed himself out of magic studies, countless bard colleges, church studies, and military training. Aeshma excels at one thing: convincing and manipulating others to gamble. He doesn't really care for the stakes or the outcome of a bet, rather he gets enjoyment out of the consternation of others. Aeshma is a chronic gambler who always pushes the stakes to their limits.

Aeshma was content to a life pursuing pleasure and with no responsibilities, but his infernal heritage has entangled him with something he could have never expected. He is the soul that the Halruuans call the Unmaker (Aeshma is unaware that he is the Unmaker). Asmodeus has plans for Aeshma and had one of his archdevils, Abigor, kidnap him.
