### Chaos Quadrapod
_Large aberration, chaotic evil_

![[Chaos Quadrapod.webp]]

A cluster of four suckered tentacles with a pulsing mass of ethereal light as its central body, the chaos quadrapod is a creature of the Far Realm, and it channels the anarchic power of that plane as it destroys all in its path. The quadrapod ambulates by flinging its mucus-covered tentacles out and dragging itself along, creating a horrid slurping sound as it advances relentlessly toward its prey.

**Chaos Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. The chaos quadrapod shoots forth a knot of roiling ethereal light that explodes at a point it can see within 60 feet of it.
