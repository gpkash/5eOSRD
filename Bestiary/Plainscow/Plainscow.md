### Plainscow
_Large beast_

![[Plainscow token.png]]

The hulking plainscow is an exceptionally sturdy beast of burden native to the [[Dividing Plains|3|Dividing Plains]] and used by the people of central Tal'Dorei for centuries. Though many wild herds still roam the plains, domesticated plainscows are more common, used as [[Mounts and Vehicles]], pack animals, and livestock. Plainscows are unusually empathetic for beasts, and often bond with a rider for life. They stand 6 feet tall, weigh about two tons, and live for 70 years.

**Market Value** Plainscows can be bought in [[Westruun]] for 200 gp. A plainscow has a carrying capacity of 1,500 pounds.
