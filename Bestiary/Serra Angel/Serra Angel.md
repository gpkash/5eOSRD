### Serra Angel
_Medium celestial, lawful good_

![[Serra Angel.webp]]

The most visible and recognized symbols of the Church of Serra are her angelsâ€”both those that were personally created by Serra and those that appeared spontaneously in the Cathedral at Sursi. Some angels live contemplative lives within the cathedrals, but most are active defenders of the faith, protecting Serra's people across the world. Powerful angels often take responsibility for large regions of the world. Lyra, for example, stands as the protector of Benalia, and Shalai plays a similar role in Llanowar. Serra's angels are believed to hear prayers addressed to Serra, and they have an uncanny tendency to arrive exactly when they are needed.

Any of the angels in the [[Monster Manual]] can serve as [[serra angel|PSD|Serra angels]]. The [[deva]] represents the most common angels, while the [[planetar]] and [[solar]] are appropriate for powerful angels such as [[Lyra|PSD]] and [[Shalai|PSD]].

**Angelic Weapons**. The deva's weapon attacks are magical. When the deva hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).

**Magic Resistance**. The deva has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The deva's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). The deva can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The deva makes two melee attacks.

**Mace**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage.

**Healing Touch (3/Day)**. The deva touches another creature. The target magically regains 20 ([[4d8 + 2) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

**Change Shape**. The deva magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the deva's choice). In a new form, the deva retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.
