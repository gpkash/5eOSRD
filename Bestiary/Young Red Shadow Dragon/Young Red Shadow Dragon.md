**Living Shadow**. While in dim light or darkness, the dragon has resistance to damage that isn't force, psychic, or radiant.

**Shadow Stealth**. While in dim light or darkness, the dragon can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

**Sunlight Sensitivity**. While in sunlight, the dragon has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

**Shadow Breath Recharge 5-6**. The dragon exhales shadowy fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, and an undead [[5eOSRD/Bestiary/Shadow/Shadow]] rises from its corpse and acts immediately after the dragon in the initiative count. The shadow is under the dragon's control.
