### Brown Scavver
_Large monstrosity, unaligned_

![[Brown Scavver.jpg]]

Brown scavvers are 10 feet long and range in color from sun-dappled brownish gold to dark umber. It takes them days to digest a meal, during which time they attack only in self-defense.

A brown scavver likes to swallow its prey whole. The creature's stomach is filled with poisonous gas, which kills off anything that survives being swallowed.

##### Actions
**Swallowing Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the scavver. The scavver can have one creature swallowed at a time. A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the scavver, and takes 13 (3d8) poison damage at the start of each of the scavver's turns from the poisonous gas in the scavver's gullet. If the scavver takes 15 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the scavver must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the scavver. If the scavver dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].
