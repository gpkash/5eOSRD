## Actions

_**Bite**_. _Melee Weapon Attack_: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit_: 2 (1d4) slashing damage. If the target is a Small or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the ankheg can bite only the [[grappled]] creature and has advantage on the attack rolls to do so.

**Acid Spray Recharge 4-6** The ankheg young messily spits acid in a cone that is 10 feet long and 10 feet wide. Each creature in that cone must make a DC 12 [[Dexterity]] saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
