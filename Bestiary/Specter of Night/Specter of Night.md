### Specter of Night
_Huge undead, neutral evil_

![[Specter of Night.webp]]

Like dark mirrors of Eldraine's archons (see " Archon of Boundaries "), specters appear as shrouded figures mounted on horrific flying beasts. It is easy to look at a specter and imagine the rider in command of the mount, but the truth is the opposite; the flying horror is an Undead monster that scours the wilds for a knightly corpse. On finding one, the horror binds its essence to the dead body, giving the corpse the semblance of life as a rider. The two function as a single creature, more powerful for their unnatural union.

Humans of Eldraine view specters as heralds of death. Specters are said to utter a keening wail, mournful beyond all other sounds and audible only to those who are about to die.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If the specter fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. The specter has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The specter uses Mournful Keening if available, then makes one Hooves attack and one Reaping Scythe attack.

**Hooves**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 28 (8d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Mournful Keening Recharge 6**. The specter utters a keening wail, calling to those close to death. Each non-Undead creature within 120 feet of the specter must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature hears the wail and is marked for death. A creature marked for death can't regain hit points, has disadvantage on death saving throws, and all attack rolls against it are made with advantage. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until the creature is targeted by a [[remove curse]] spell or similar magic.

**Reaping Scythe**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (1d12 + 6) slashing damage plus 28 (8d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of [[exhaustion]].
