**Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).** The githyanki's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The githyanki makes two silver greatsword attacks.

**Silver Greatsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage. This is a magic weapon attack. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the [[astral projection]] spell), the githyanki can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
