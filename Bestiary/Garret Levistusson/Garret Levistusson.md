**Bardic Inspiration (3/Day)**. As a bonus action, Garret can give one chosen creature (other than him) a d6 inspiration die.

A creature can have only one inspiration die at a time.

**Cunning Action**. On each of his turns, Garret can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
