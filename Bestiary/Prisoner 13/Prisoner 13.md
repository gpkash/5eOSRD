### Prisoner 13
_Medium humanoid (dwarf, monk), neutral evil_

![[Prisoner 13.webp]]

Prisoner 13 is a dwarf named Korda Glintstone. Prior to her incarceration years ago, Korda was an ally and agent of Clan Axebreaker, a moderately influential dwarf clan in a stronghold called Gauntlgrym. Korda built a network of informants and agents, ostensibly all to the benefit of Clan Axebreaker. With each success, she paid tattooists to inscribe a memorial of her triumph onto her skin. Using ancient rituals, Korda infused many of these artful etchings with the magic of Gauntlgrym's forges, granting her wondrous gifts.

Korda grew too ambitious for her role as an agent, so she devised a plan to take power for herself. Over five years she took careful stock of Clan Axebreaker's wealth and, in one fell swoop, used her network of lieutenants to steal away most of the clan's gold, leaving only a pittance.

Prisoner 13 is a cunning schemer, ruthless and patient. She listens and watches, absorbing every detail she can, and shares as little as she can get away with.


**Prisoner 13's Tattoos** Most of Prisoner 13's inkwork is covered by her uniform. Her tattoos include the following:



Traced among Prisoner 13's tattoos are tiny magical sigils, each one matching a twin tattooed on one of her agents. A character who examines any visible tattoos and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices some of the hidden marks.

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check determines that the sigils have something to do with minds or telepathy.

**Antimagic Susceptibility**. In an area of antimagic, Prisoner 13's tattoos and reactions don't function, and she suffers the following modifications to her statistics: her AC becomes 13, she loses her immunity to psychic damage and the charmed condition, and her Tattooed Strike becomes a melee attack that deals 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage on a hit.

**Mindlink Tattoos**. Prisoner 13 has telepathic links with dozens of agents operating throughout the land. The links allow Prisoner 13 to communicate telepathically with each of these agents while they are both on the same plane of existence.

**Mountain Tattoo**. Prisoner 13's AC includes her Constitution modifier.

**Shroud Tattoo**. Prisoner 13 can't be targeted by divination spells or any feature that would read her thoughts, and she can't be perceived through magical scrying sensors. She can't be contacted telepathically unless she allows such contact.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Prisoner 13 makes two Tattooed Strike attacks.

**Tattooed Strike**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) force damage.

**Firestorm Tattoo Recharge 5-6**. Prisoner 13 magically unleashes flame from the tattoo across her back, filling a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her. Each other creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 (3d8) fire damage and is knocked [[prone]]. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[prone]].

**River Tattoo**. Prisoner 13 magically ends any effects causing the [[grappled]] or [[restrained]] conditions on herself. If she is bound with nonmagical restraints, she slips out of them.

#### Reactions
**Readiness**. When a creature Prisoner 13 can see within 60 feet of herself ends its turn, Prisoner 13 makes one Tattooed Strike attack or uses River Tattoo. She can then move up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
