### Amidor the Dandelion
_Small plant, neutral good_

![[Amidor the Dandelion.jpg]]

**Roleplaying Notes** This 3-foot-tall talking dandelion finds poetry in everything and is quick to fall head over heels in love. A humble idealist, Amidor never puts its own needs above the needs of others.

**Alignment** Neutral good.


**Personality Trait** "My speech drifts into flowery verse, if you'll pardon the pun. Allow

me to demonstrate: Do not cry, my love! Let me catch your tears as faeries collect morning dew. Let me lift your spirits like a seed on the breeze!"


**Ideal** "The pursuit of true love compels me! Never shall I wilt if I have such a cause to champion."


**Bond** "The beautiful Pollenellaâ€”a vision in stripes."


**Flaw** "I cannot resist a pretty face or a heavenly scent."
