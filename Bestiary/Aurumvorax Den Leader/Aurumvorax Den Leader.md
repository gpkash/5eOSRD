**Pack Leader**. The aurumvorax's allies have advantage on attack rolls while within 10 feet of the aurumvorax, provided it isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Tunneler**. The aurumvorax can burrow through solid rock and metal at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 5-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The aurumvorax makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature wearing armor of any type, the aurumvorax gains one of the following benefits of its choice:

**Frenzy**. The aurumvorax has advantage on attack rolls until start of its next turn.

**Invigorate**. The aurumvorax regains 6 ([[1d8 + 2) hit points.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the aurumvorax can't use its Claw attack on another target, and when it moves, it can drag the [[grappled]] creature with it, without the aurumvorax's speed being halved.
