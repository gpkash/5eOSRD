**Legendary Resistance (4/Day)**. If Shemeshka fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. Shemeshka has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Special Equipment**. Shemeshka carries a magic crown called the Razorvine Tiara. In the hands of anyone other than Shemeshka, the Razorvine Tiara functions as a tentacle rod that deals slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

**Spellcasting.** Shemeshka casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Shemeshka uses Arcane Flux or Spellcasting. She then makes one Claw attack or one attack with her Razorvine Tiara.

**Arcane Flux**. Shemeshka causes a surge of arcane energy to burst around one creature she can see within 120 feet of herself. The target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 45 (7d12) force damage and has the [[incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage.

**Razorvine Tiara**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or its speed is halved and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of its next turn.

#### Reactions
**Fell Counterspell (3/Day)**. Shemeshka utters a magical word to interrupt a creature she can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 5th level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 6th level or higher, Shemeshka makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect. Whatever the spell's level, the caster gains the [[poisoned]] condition until the end of its next turn.
