**Dark One's Blessing**. When Bol'bara reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, she gains 6 temporary hit points.

**Nimble Escape**. Bol'bara can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of her turns.

**Innate Spellcasting.** Bol'bara's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Bol'bara makes two melee attacks.

**Dagger**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

**Eldritch Blast (Cantrip)**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) force damage.

##### Legendary Actions
**Incorporeal Dash**. Bol'bara moves up to her speed. She can move through other creatures and objects as if they were [[difficult terrain]]. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.

**Zone of Calamity (Costs 2 Actions)**. A 15-foot-radius sphere of magical confusion extends from a point Bol'bara can see within 60 feet of her and spreads around corners. Each creature that starts its turn in that area is treated as if targeted by the [[confusion]] spell (save DC 12). The sphere lasts as long as Bol'bara maintains [[concentration]], up to 1 minute (as if [[concentration||concentrating]] on a spell).
