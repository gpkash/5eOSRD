### Brahma Lutier
_Medium humanoid (elf), neutral_

![[The B Team.jpg]]

Formally a former member of the "B" Team, Brahma Lutier is a gifted cartographer, spy, and troubadour. Tutored in at least the latter of those vocations by Audra Courtier (wife of Propha Dran and co-owner of the Dran & Courtier inn of Red Larch), Brahma's specialty is a song of domination that is legendarily difficult to resist.

Her retirement is said to be connected to a falling out with husband Oak Truestrike, and Brahma has been operating as a solo agent for some time now. Known for a personality that is murderous and cheery in equal part, she utilizes an instrument of dragonborn design in combat. Known as a war lute, this unique item comes replete with hidden storage and powerful weaponry.

**Fey Ancestry**. Brahma has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put her to sleep.

**Taunt (2/Day)**. Brahma can use a bonus action to target one creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can hear Brahma, it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of Brahma's next turn.

**Spellcasting.** Brahma is a 4th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following bard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): [[mage hand]], [[message]], [[vicious mockery]]
1st level (4 slots): [[charm person]], [[heroism]], [[illusory script]], [[sleep]], [[unseen servant]]
2nd level (3 slots): [[cloud of daggers]], [[invisibility]]

##### Actions
**War Lute**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

**Song of Domination (3/Day)**. Brahma targets one creature that can see or hear her, which must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[charmed]] by her for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. It has disadvantage on these saves if being [[charmed]] by Brahma is something the target openly or secretly desires. For 1 hour after the charm effect ends, the target has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma checks made as part of a contest with Brahma.
