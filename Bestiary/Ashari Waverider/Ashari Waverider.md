**Healing Tides**. Whenever the waverider casts a spell of 1st level or higher that affects a non-hostile creature, that creature regains 3 hit points (in addition to any healing the spell may provide).

**Marine Empathy**. The waverider can speak with and understand aquatic plants and animals.

**Spellcasting.** The waverider is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following druid spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): [[druidcraft]], [[poison spray]] (2d12), [[resistance]]
1st level (4 slots): [[create or destroy water]], [[cure wounds]], [[healing word]]
2nd level (3 slots): [[animal messenger]], [[lesser restoration]], [[moonbeam]]
3rd level (3 slots): [[conjure animals]] (aquatic beasts only), [[water breathing]], [[water walk]]
4th level (1 slots): [[control water]]

##### Actions
**Harpoon**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a Strength contest against the waverider or be pulled up to 20 feet toward the waverider. Attacks with this weapon made while [[Underwater Combat|underwater]] do not have disadvantage.

#### Reactions
**Fishform (Recharges after a [[Short Rest]] or [[Long Rest]])**. The waverider can transform into a [[hunter shark]] or a [[giant octopus]]. Its game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen creature, but the waverider retains its alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also retains its skill proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature it transforms into. When the waverider is reduced to 0 hit points, falls [[unconscious]], or dies in this form, it reverts to its humanoid form. It can remain in fishform for up to 3 hours or until it reverts to its humanoid form as a bonus action.
