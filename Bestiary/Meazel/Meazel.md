### Meazel
_Medium humanoid (meazel), lawful evil_

![[Meazel.webp]]

Meazels are malicious hermits who fled to the Shadowfell to escape their mortal existence and contemplate their misery. There the shadows transformed them, and their bitterness made them twisted and cruel. Now hate burns in their hearts, and they resent any intrusion into their suffering, waylaying travelers who venture too close to their lairs.

The evil that corrupted meazels also imbued them with magical powers that allow them to move through shadows with ease. They can step from one pool of darkness into another one, using this talent to ambush prey. Sometimes they snatch victims around the throat with their strangling cords and then step away; other times they ferry their victims to isolated spots and then leave the hapless souls to the designs of whatever horrors lurk there.

Any creatures meazels draw through the shadows are cursed by the meazels' baleful magic. The curse acts as a beacon; sorrowsworn (which appear in this book), Undead, and other terrors sense where they are located and descend on the stranded victims to tear them apart.

**Shadow Stealth**. While in dim light or darkness, the meazel can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

##### Actions
**Garrote**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target of the meazel's size or smaller. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 13 with disadvantage). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the meazel's turns. The meazel can't make weapon attacks while grappling a creature in this way.

**Shortsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.

**Shadow Teleport Recharge 5-6**. The meazel, any equipment it is wearing or carrying, and any creature it is grappling teleport to an unoccupied space within 500 feet of it, provided that the starting space and the destination are in dim light or darkness. The destination must be a place the meazel has seen before, but it need not be within line of sight. If the destination space is occupied, the teleportation leads to the nearest unoccupied space. Any other creature the meazel teleports becomes cursed by shadow for 1 hour. Until this curse ends, every undead and every creature native to the Shadowfell within 300 feet of the cursed creature can sense it, which prevents that creature from hiding from them.
