**Magic Resistance**. The clockwork kraken has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Independent Tentacles**. The clockwork kraken has eight tentacles, each of which is treated as a Medium creature, moves independently on the construct's turn, and has a flying speed of 40 feet. The clockwork kraken's senses operate through its tentacles as well as its main body. Each tentacle can be attacked independently, with damage dealt to tentacles applied to the clockwork kraken's hit point total. A tentacle is destroyed if it takes more than 20 damage. Reducing the construct to three or fewer tentacles reduces its attacks accordingly. A clockwork kraken can regrow any destroyed tentacles at the end of a long rest.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The clockwork kraken makes four tentacle slam attacks.

**Tentacle Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
