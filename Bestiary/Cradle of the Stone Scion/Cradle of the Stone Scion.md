**Awakening of the Scion**. The cradle is a container for the [[scion of Skoraeus|BGG]]. When the cradle drops to 0 hit points, its body crumbles to dust. The scion instantly appears in the space the cradle occupied and uses the cradle's initiative count.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day)**. If the cradle fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. The cradle has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster**. The cradle deals double damage to objects and structures.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The cradle makes two Slam or Spit Rock attacks.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

**Spit Rock**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Shattering Roar Recharge 5-6**. The cradle lets out a painfully load roar. Each creature within 60 feet of the cradle must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (6d10) thunder damage and has the [[incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn.
