### Nintra Siotta
_Large fey, chaotic evil_

![[Nintra Siotta.webp]]

Nintra Siotta, a chaotic evil archfey who was exiled from the Gloaming Court by the Queen of Air and Darkness long ago, is known in Faer√ªn by three titles: Princess of the Shadow Glass, Lady of Dread Omens, and Seeker of the Three Crowns. She appears as a 9-foot-tall humanoid made of smoky gray glass, wrapped in a cloak-like darkness that appears to devour the light.

Nintra's eyes burn with green fire, and she speaks in a high, musical voice. Deception comes naturally to her, but imprisonment in [[The Scrivener's Tale]]has made her impatient and prone to telepathic outbursts that betray her cruel nature.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Nintra fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Spellcasting.** Nintra casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (save DC 20) and requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Nintra makes two attacks.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d4 + 7) piercing damage.

**Shard of Shadow**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d6 + 7) necrotic damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the end of its next turn.

**Storm of Shattered Glass Recharge 6**. Nintra targets a point she can see within 60 feet of her and creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of swirling glass shards centered on that point. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. If Nintra is in the sphere, the shards deal no damage to her.

##### Legendary Actions
**Attack**. Nintra makes one attack.

**Fey Step**. Nintra teleports to an unoccupied space she can see within 30 feet of her.

**Shadow Strikes (Costs 2 Actions)**. Provided she is in bright or dim light, Nintra causes her shadow to attack a creature within 10 feet of her. Her shadow makes two claw attacks, each attack identical to Nintra's claw attack except that it deals psychic damage instead of piercing damage.
