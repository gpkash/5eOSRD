### Morte
_Tiny undead, chaotic good_

![[Morte.webp]]

The talking skull Morte is a curmudgeonly interplanar traveler plucked from his eternal punishment in the Nine Hells. Tormented by the lies he told in life, Morte masks his pain with a morbid sense of humor and an insufferable dose of sarcasm.
