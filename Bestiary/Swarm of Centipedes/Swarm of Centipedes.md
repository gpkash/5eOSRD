**Swarm**. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

##### Actions
**Bites**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a swarm of centipedes is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]] in this way.
