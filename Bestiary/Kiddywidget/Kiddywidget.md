### Kiddywidget
_Small construct, _

![[Kiddywidget.webp]]

A skitterwidget that gives birth to a kiddywidget can't procreate for 3d6 days afterward. Still, given that skitterwidgets are constructs with no natural life span, there is no telling how many kiddywidgets a pair of skitterwidgets can produce.
