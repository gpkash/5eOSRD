**Divinely Blessed**. Alyxian can't be [[surprise|surprised]] and can't be changed into another form against his will.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day)**. If Alyxian fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Special Equipment**. Alyxian carries a magic dagger that he uses to make Stoneheart Dagger attacks. In the hands of creatures other than Alyxian, the dagger is nonmagical and has no special properties.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Alyxian makes two Spear attacks.

**Spear**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.

**Stoneheart Dagger**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (3d4 + 4) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become [[petrified]] as the dagger lodges itself in the target's body. While the dagger is lodged in the target, magic can't end the [[petrified]] condition on it and Alyxian can't make Stoneheart Dagger attacks. A creature within reach of the [[petrified]] target can use an action to try to remove the dagger, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength check.

##### Legendary Actions
**Attack**. Alyxian makes one Spear or Stoneheart Dagger attack.

**Warrior's Stride**. Alyxian moves up to his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

**Ruidium Shard (Costs 2 Actions)**. A gem-sized shard of ruidium appears at a point Alyxian can see within 120 feet of himself and explodes. Each creature, other than Alyxian, in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]]. If a creature isn't suffering from ruidium corruption, it becomes corrupted when it fails the saving throw.

#### Reactions
**Parry**. Alyxian adds 3 to his AC against one attack roll that would hit him. To do so, Alyxian must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
