### Spectral Cloud
_Huge undead, neutral_

![[Spectral Cloud.webp]]

A cloud giant that dies through an act of betrayal or an ill-fated wager sometimes returns as a spectral cloud. While this Undead seems to be merely a thick cloud or fog bank, observers can sometimes spot a shadowy bipedal figure lurking within. At the heart of the cloud, the figure's appearance becomes clear: a skeletal cloud giant corpse.

Tales suggest cloud giants sometimes seek this fate rather than accept the end of their naturally long lives. In such stories, a cloud giant undergoes a ritual in which its heart is transplanted into a cloud, causing the giant's body to dissolve and its spirit to animate the cloud.

**Blurred Form**. Attack rolls against the spectral cloud are made with disadvantage unless the attacker is within 15 feet of the spectral cloud or the spectral cloud is [[incapacitated]].

**Incorporeal Movement**. The spectral cloud can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The spectral cloud makes two Spectral Touch attacks.

**Spectral Touch**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) force damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. A Humanoid slain by this attack immediately rises as a miniature spectral cloud (use the specter stat block in the Monster Manual). The miniature spectral cloud acts as an ally of its creator but isn't under its control.

**Chilling Winds Recharge 5-6**. The spectral cloud emits intensely cold wind in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 38 (7d10) cold damage and has the [[incapacitated]] condition for 1 minute. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, that creature is immune to this spectral cloud's Chilling Winds for the next 24 hours.
