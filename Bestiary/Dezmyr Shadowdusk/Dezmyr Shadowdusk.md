**Magic Resistance**. The death knight has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Marshal Undead**. Unless the death knight is [[incapacitated]], it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead.

**Spellcasting.** The death knight is a 19th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following paladin spells prepared:

1st level (4 slots): [[command]], [[compelled duel]], [[searing smite]]
2nd level (3 slots): [[hold person]], [[magic weapon]]
3rd level (3 slots): [[dispel magic]], [[elemental weapon]]
4th level (3 slots): [[banishment]], [[staggering smite]]
5th level (2 slots): [[destructive wave]] (necrotic)

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The death knight makes three longsword attacks.

**Longsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.

**Hellfire Orb (1/Day)**. The death knight hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 35 (10d6) fire damage and 35 (10d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Reactions
**Parry**. The death knight adds 6 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the death knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
