### Ogre Chitterlord
_Large giant (druid), any alignment_

![[Ogre Chitterlord.jpg]]

When ogres first moved into the wilds of Eldraine, they encountered all manner of unfamiliar creatures: spellcasting witches, tricksy faeries, and talking beasts. Over generations, these ogres adapted to their new environs, passing down a spellcasting tradition of their own to help their kin wreak havoc in the wilds and beyond.

An ogre chitterlord exercises control over the rats that infest Dunbarrow and countless other regions in the wilds of Eldraine. When ogres venture from the wilds to raid nearby settlements, an ogre chitterlord often leads the way, calling rats from the alleys and sewers to harry townsfolk from within the city while the ogres lay siege to the outer walls. Should their rodent allies fail them, chitterlords can also turn the tide of any battle with their prodigious strength and druidic magic.
