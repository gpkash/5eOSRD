### Giant Ram
_Large fey, unaligned_

![[Giant Ram.jpg]]

Giant rams are prized livestock among giants. The rams' fleece stores magical energy by absorbing ambient magic and drawing power from spells. While a ram is alive and unshorn, it uses its fleece's magic for self-defense, channeling the power it absorbs into a magical blast to drive off predators.

If the fleece is shorn from the ram without damaging the creature, it can be made into a protective magical garment. When woven into cloth, the fleece serves as a cloak of protection. It can also be woven into the lining of armor to make armor of resistance that protects against cold, fire, or lightning damage.
