**Divinely Blessed**. Alyxian can't be [[surprise|surprised]] and can't be changed into another form against his will.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day)**. If Alyxian fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Spellcasting.** Alyxian casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting modifier (spell save DC 17):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Alyxian makes two Spear attacks.

**Spear**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.

**Force Wave (1/Day)**. Alyxian strikes the ground, creating a burst of energy that ripples outward. Each creature he chooses within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on himself must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 35 (10d6) force damage and be knocked [[prone]]. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[prone]].

##### Legendary Actions
**Arch Heart's Strike**. Alyxian makes one Spear attack, and all damage from this attack is radiant.

**Change Bringer's Dance**. Alyxian moves up to his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

**Moon Weaver's Veil (Costs 2 Actions)**. Alyxian becomes [[invisible]] until the end of his next turn. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying becomes [[invisible]] with him.
