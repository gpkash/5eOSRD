### Irvan Wastewalker (Tier 3)
_Medium humanoid (human), chaotic neutral_

![[Irvan Wastewalker (Tier 3).jpg]]

The name "Wastewalker" conjures fear on the plains of Xhorhas, as the name of a clan of Xhorhasian nomads. Irvan—Irv to his friends—was born into that clan, but he hates the name. He left his family when he was a teenager, struck out on his own across the wastes, and made his way to the city of Asarius. Even though the "City of Beasts" is renowned for danger, Irv felt at home there in a way he'd never felt with his clan.

He earned a reputation for being a party animal who could put down a dozen drinks in a night and still dance with the vigor and elegance of an archfey. Irv is young—just a few weeks past his nineteenth birthday—and he is secretly ashamed of his patchy beard and scrawny, human body. He has a bigger secret related to that feeling: he was consecuted in another life. The act of consecution is a sacred Kryn ritual of rebirth through the mystical power of the Luxon. Irvan has memories of his previous life as a bugbear of Den Hythenos, and he hopes to prove to himself that he can do great things without the aid of his powerful "family" in the Kryn Dynasty.

He met Ayo and her friends when he traveled to Jigow to experience its contests of strength and skill. He sticks with the group in part because he's interested in what adventures they'll get into, and also because he's smitten with the group's newest addition, a drow arcanist named Galsariad.

**Battle Chatter Sample Quotes** "Heh, that was a good hit, wasn't it?" "Come on, come on! Eyes on me!" "Can I have this dance? No?"



**Rival Stat Blocks** Stat blocks for the rivals can be found in appendix A. Each of the rivals has three stat blocks; like the characters, they become more powerful as the adventure progresses. The Rival Stat Blocks table shows you which stat blocks to use based on the chapter you are running.

Their journey has forced the tier 3 rivals to make decisions, sometimes out of grim necessity, that they might have not made earlier. All five suffer from ruidium corruption (see "Ruidium "in the introduction). When the characters encounter them, assume that the rivals have removed all levels of exhaustion from themselves through rest or magic, but the other effects of ruidium corruption remain.

If instead you want to weaken the rivals to make them less of a physical threat or reinforce the danger of ruidium corruption, you can give one or more of the rivals 1d4 levels of exhaustion each. In this case, you'll need to keep track of each rival's exhaustion level and the condition's corresponding effects (see "Exhaustion "in the [[Player's Handbook]]).

**Useful Magic** To facilitate their efforts, Galsariad has learned the water breathing spell. Additionally, all the rivals have acquired ruidium equipment to protect them from the effects of underwater pressure.


**Irvan's Prosthetic Arm** During a misadventure that unfolded while the rivals were apart from the characters, Irvan Wastewalker lost an arm and gained an arcane prosthetic. This magic item functions for no one else.

**Fortitude (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. If damage reduces Irvan to 0 hit points, he can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 + the damage taken. On a successful save, Irvan drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Special Equipment**. Irvan wears gloves of swimming and climbing and wields a ruidium shortsword (see appendix B). If Irvan rolls a 1 on an attack roll made with the shortsword, he must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]]. In addition, Irvan has a magical prosthetic arm. While the arm is attached to him, it functions the same as the body part it is replacing. Irvan can attach or detach the arm as an action, and it can't be removed by anyone else.
