### Malaxxix
_Huge fiend (yugoloth), neutral evil_

![[Malaxxix.webp]]

Legends describe the dread being Malaxxix as the child of one of the night hags who created the first yugoloths. Malaxxix is often lumped in with such Fiends, perhaps because it too has a grand intellect and self-centered agenda.

Malaxxix's machinations are many, but it is most infamous for crafting cursed armaments and distributing them throughout the multiverse in the hope that they'll be found by mortals who are desperate for power and ripe for corruption.

Malaxxix seeks the[[Books of Keeping]]: ancient tomes that contain the true names of all yugoloths. To this end, it patrols the vilest swaths of the multiverse from atop its unholy vehicle, the Unborn Palanquin. This shambling collective is made up of thousands of mezzoloths devoted to their liege, who roams the Lower Planes as a tyrannical marauder.


**Curse of Malaxxix** A creature that attunes to one of Malaxxix's cursed items becomes afflicted with the curse of Malaxxix. The curse enables Malaxxix to interact with the cursed creature in special ways:

**Scrying** Malaxxix can cast the Scrying spell on the cursed creature without material components or a spell slot. Malaxxix doesn't need to be on the same plane of existence as the creature to use this ability, and the creature automatically fails the saving throw against the spell.

**Teleport** As an action, Malaxxix can teleport, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the cursed creature, regardless of the creature's location in the multiverse.

The curse of Malaxxix lasts until ended with a Remove Curse spell, a Greater Restoration spell, or similar magic.


**Malaxxix's Lair** The Unborn Palanquin—a monstrous, centipedal vehicle—serves as both Malaxxix's primary conveyance and the Fiend's lair.

Malaxxix can take lair actions (see below) while astride the palanquin. When encountered on the palanquin, Malaxxix's challenge rating is 19 (22,000 XP).

**The Unborn Palanquin** The [[Unborn Palanquin]] is a wormlike leviathan of screeching gears made up of hundreds of tireless mezzoloths. It is a unique vehicle and Gargantuan object.

Only Malaxxix can pilot this vehicle. If Malaxxix is slain, the palanquin crumbles in seconds.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Malaxxix fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. Malaxxix has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Malaxxix makes two Forge Hammer or Whip attacks in any combination.

**Forge Hammer**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 60/180 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the end of Malaxxix's next turn. Hit or Miss: The hammer then magically returns to Malaxxix's hand.

**Whip**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage, and the target has the [[restrained]] condition for 1 minute. The [[restrained]] target can make a DC 20 Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Only one creature can be [[restrained]] by the whip at a time.

**Mezzoloth Vortex Recharge 5-6**. Malaxxix summons a vortex of whirling mezzoloths at a point it can see within 90 feet of itself. The vortex is a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature other than Malaxxix in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 35 (10d6) force damage and has the [[restrained]] condition while within the cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder. The vortex lasts until the start of Malaxxix's next turn.

##### Legendary Actions
**Fiendish Stride**. Malaxxix moves up to its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. When Malaxxix moves within 5 feet of a creature during this movement, that creature takes 5 (1d10) lightning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

**Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**. Malaxxix makes one Forge Hammer or Whip attack.
