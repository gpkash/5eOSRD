### Blackguard
_Medium humanoid (any race), any non-good alignment_

Blackguards are paladins who broke their sacred oaths and now indulge their own villainous ambitions. They consort with Fiends and Undead, and they reject many of the goodly things from their former lives.

Blackguards often adorn their armor and weapons with dread accoutrements or are marked by eerie phenomena. You may choose a blackguard's accoutrement or roll on the Blackguard Accoutrements table to determine it.

**Spellcasting.** The blackguard is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following paladin spells prepared:

1st level (4 slots): [[command]], [[protection from evil and good]], [[thunderous smite]]
2nd level (3 slots): [[branding smite]], [[find steed]]
3rd level (2 slots): [[blinding smite]], [[dispel magic]]

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The blackguard makes three attacks with its glaive or its shortbow.

**Glaive**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage.

**Shortbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

**Dreadful Aspect (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. The blackguard exudes magical menace. Each enemy within 30 feet of the blackguard must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] for 1 minute. If a [[frightened]] target ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the blackguard, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
