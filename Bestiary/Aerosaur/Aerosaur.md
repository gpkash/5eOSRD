**Magic Resistance**. The aerosaur has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The aerosaur makes one Bite attack and one Talons attack.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (3d12 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target has the [[restrained]] condition, and the aerosaur can't Bite another target.

**Talons**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d10 + 8) slashing damage.

**Wing Gusts Recharge 5-6**. The aerosaur beats its wings, creating bursts of thunderous force. Each creature within 10 feet of the aerosaur must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 38 (7d10) thunder damage, is pushed up to 30 feet horizontally from the aerosaur, and has the [[prone]] condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed up to 15 feet horizontally from the aerosaur.
