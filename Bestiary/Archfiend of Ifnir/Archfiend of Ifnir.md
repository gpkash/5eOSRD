**Magic Resistance**. The nalfeshnee has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The nalfeshnee uses Horror Nimbus if it can. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (5d10 + 5) piercing damage.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.

**Horror Nimbus Recharge 5-6**. The nalfeshnee magically emits scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature within 15 feet of the nalfeshnee that can see the light must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the nalfeshnee's Horror Nimbus for the next 24 hours.

**Teleport**. The nalfeshnee magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
