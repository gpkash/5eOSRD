Sirenes are fey creatures that live along the cliffs and jagged rocks of the Sword Coast. Equally comfortable on land or beneath the waves, sirenes prefer to keep close to shore and rarely go out into deep water. They are famed for their beautiful singing that often lures sailors to steer their ships to disaster on the coast.

**Territorial** Sirenes live together in small bands. They are extremely territorial and try to drive out any other humanoid that trespasses in their domain. They initially use non-deadly means to convince intruders to leave, but if that is not successful, they are willing to kill.


**Beautiful Song** Sirenes love to sing and use their music to communicate amongst themselves. Their songs are beautiful and haunting, but usually not magical in nature. Only when they are in danger will they weave magic into their songs.


**Skilled Warriors** Sirenes are deadly warriors who use their skills to hunt for food and to kill those who trespass on their territory. Their wicked daggers are made from bone and are their primary weapon when they travel beneath the water. They store their bows close to shore, ready to be retrieved if needed.
