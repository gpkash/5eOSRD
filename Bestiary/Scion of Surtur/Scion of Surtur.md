**Legendary Resistance (6/Day)**. If the scion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. The scion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster**. The scion deals double damage to objects and structures.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The scion makes one attack using Lava Blade or Lava Ball, as well as two Slam attacks.

**Lava Blade**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +18 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (4d10 + 10) slashing damage plus 18 (4d8) fire damage.

**Lava Ball**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +18 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 29 (3d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 26 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d8 + 10) force damage.

**Lava Wave Recharge 5-6**. The scion emits a wave of lava from its blade, hands, or mouth in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 60 (11d10) fire damage and has the [[restrained]] condition from being embedded in hardening rock. A creature can make a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check as an action, freeing itself or a creature within reach from the rock on a success. The rock has AC 17 and 40 hit points, and it is immune to fire, poison, and psychic damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
