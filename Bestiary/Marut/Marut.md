### Marut
_Large construct (inevitable), lawful neutral_

![[Marut.webp]]

The nigh-unstoppable inevitables serve a singular purpose: they enforce contracts forged in the Hall of Concordance in the city of Sigil. Primus, the leader of the modrons, created maruts and other inevitables to bring order to dealings between planar folk. A wide array of disparate creatures, including yugoloths, will enter into a contract with inevitables if asked.

The Hall of Concordance is an embassy of pure law in Sigil, the City of Doors. In the hall, parties who agree to mutual terms—and who pay the requisite gold to the Kolyarut, a mechanical engine of absolute jurisprudence—can have their contract chiseled onto a sheet of gold that is placed in the chest of a marut. From that moment until the contract is fulfilled, the marut is bound to enforce its terms and to punish any party who breaks them. A marut resorts to lethal force only if a contract calls for it, if the contract is fully broken, or if the marut is attacked.

Inevitables care nothing for the spirit of an agreement, only the letter. A marut enforces what is written, not what was meant by or supposed to be understood from the writing. The Kolyarut rejects contracts that contain vague, contradictory, or unenforceable terms. Beyond that, it doesn't care whether both parties understand what they're agreeing to.

**Immutable Form**. The marut is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If the marut fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. The marut has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The marut's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 20). The marut can innately cast the following spell, requiring no material components.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The marut makes two slam attacks.

**Unerring Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 60 force damage, and the target is pushed up to 5 feet away from the marut if it is Huge or smaller.

**Blazing Edict Recharge 5-6**. Arcane energy emanates from the marut's chest in a 60-foot cube. Every creature in that area takes 45 radiant damage. Each creature that takes any of this damage must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of the marut's next turn.

**Justify**. The marut targets up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to a teleportation circle in the Hall of Concordance in Sigil. A target fails automatically if it is [[incapacitated]]. If either target is teleported in this way, the marut teleports with it to the circle. After teleporting in this way, the marut can't use this action again until it finishes a short or long rest.
