**Dragon Fanatic**. The dragonsoul has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]]. While the dragonsoul can see a dragon or higher-ranking Cult of the Dragon cultist friendly to it, the dragonsoul ignores the effects of being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]].

**Fanatic Advantage**. Once per turn, if the dragonsoul makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage.

**Limited Flight**. The dragonsoul can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of its turn.

**Pack Tactics**. The dragonsoul has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dragonsoul's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].
