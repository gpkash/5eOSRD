### Droki
_Small humanoid (derro), chaotic evil_

![[Droki.webp]]

**Roleplaying Droki** Droki hates everyone in general and surfacers in particular. He gnashes his teeth if he has to address the characters, taking every opportunity to be insulting and misleading. If the characters look through his satchel while he's still conscious, he throws an epic tantrum and becomes intractable until knocked [[unconscious]].

Droki is also obsessed with things happening where and when they should. If he is captured before he runs his errands in the Whorlstone Tunnels, he constantly complains about the characters altering fate by delaying him, and a good tactic to pressure him is to threaten to hold him indefinitely. He prefers to escape than to fight, except if the characters take his satchel.

**Shortsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. The sword is coated with serpent venom that wears off after the first hit. A target subjected to the venom must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Reactions
**Parry**. Droki adds 3 to his AC against one melee attack that would hit him. To do so, Droki must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
