**Amphibious**. The aboleth can breathe air and water.

**Mucous Cloud**. While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only underwater.

**Probing Telepathy**. If a creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by [[heal]] or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Enslave (3/Day)**. The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [[charmed]] by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The [[charmed]] target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. Whenever the [[charmed]] target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.

##### Legendary Actions
**Detect**. The aboleth makes a Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check.

**Tail Swipe**. The aboleth makes one tail attack.

**Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions)**. One creature [[charmed]] by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.
