### Parasite-infested Behir
_Huge undead, neutral evil_

![[Parasite-infested Behir token.png]]

When a parasite-infested behir roars or discharges their lightning breath, thousands of gray, parasitic blood worms can be seen writhing inside their mouths. Targeting the behir with magic that removes a disease kills off its blood parasites.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.

**Constrict**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage. The target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is [[restrained]] until this grapple ends.

**Lightning Breath Recharge 5-6**. The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Swallow**. The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time. Any creature swallowed by a parasite-infested behir must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the behir's turns or be feasted upon by blood parasites, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. This damage is in addition to the damage caused by the behir's digestive acids. If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].
