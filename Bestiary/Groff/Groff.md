### Groff
_Large plant, unaligned_

![[Groff.jpg]]

Many a Strixhaven student wandering the bayou has stepped on a seemingly mundane patch of moss—only to discover that it was the back of a hungry groff lurking beneath the surface. These shaggy swamp creatures have canine faces and glowing blue eyes, and they are ravenous carnivores—with pest mascots being their favorite food. A handful of more intrepid Witherbloom mages have learned to follow groffs in order to track down pest mascots, but most of these mages have yet to find a way to capture the pests before the groff eats someone.

**False Appearance**. If the groff is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the groff move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the groff isn't an ordinary moss-covered bog patch.

**Hold Breath**. The groff can hold its breath for up to 1 hour.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The groff makes one Bite attack and one Swamp Claw attack.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage.

**Swamp Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become engulfed by the groff. While engulfed, the target can't breathe, is [[restrained]], and takes 10 (3d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. When the groff moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The groff can have only one target engulfed at a time. An engulfed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns. On a success, the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space.
