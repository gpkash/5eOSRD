### Description  
Goblins are small, black-hearted humanoids that lair in despoiled dungeons and other dismal settings. Individually weak, they gather in large numbers to torment other creatures.  

Goblin archers have honed their skills with the shortbow and are among the best of their tribe. They are lethal on the battlefield and in close quarters. Numerous warriors have been surprised by the skill of these archers and have lost their lives as a result of assuming they were simply ordinary goblins.
