### Description  
Goblins are small, black-hearted humanoids that lair in despoiled dungeons and other dismal settings. Individually weak, they gather in large numbers to torment other creatures.  

The goblin commander is the strongest warrior in the tribe. It acts as the loyal defender of the goblin king and also provides military advice to the king. Wielding a battleaxe and wearing much heavier armor than the average goblin, the commander is a force to be reckoned with in any fight.
