### Description  
Goblins are small, black-hearted humanoids that lair in despoiled dungeons and other dismal settings. Individually weak, they gather in large numbers to torment other creatures.  

Goblin sentries are amongst their tribe's most dependable warriors. They perform guard duty and are the first line of defense for most tribes. As with goblin archers, many an adventurer has underestimated the abilities of a goblin sentry and suffered an ignominious defeat as a result.
