### Actions  

- **Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.  
  _Hit:_ 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the lamprey can’t bite another target.  

- **Swallow.** The lamprey makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the lamprey, and takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the lamprey’s turns. The lamprey can have only one target swallowed at a time.  

  If the lamprey dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.  

- **Mucus (Recharge 5–6).** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature.  
  _Hit:_ The target is restrained by mucus. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 15 Strength check, bursting the mucus on a success. The mucus can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to acid damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
