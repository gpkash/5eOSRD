##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The lizard makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. One attack can be replaced by Swallow.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the lizard can't bite another target.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Swallow**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature the lizard is grappling. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage. The target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the lizard, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the lizard's turns. The lizard can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the lizard dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].
