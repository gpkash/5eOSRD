**Fey Ancestry**. The elf has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid or end the [[charmed]] condition on itself, and magic can't put it to sleep.

**Special Equipment**. The elf wears a suit of [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Elven Chain/Elven Chain]].

**Unusual Nature**. The elf doesn't require sleep.

**Spellcasting.** The elf casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The elf makes two Scimitar attacks and uses Radiant Beam (if available).

**Scimitar**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) radiant damage.

**Radiant Beam (3/Day)**. A magical beam of radiance flashes out from the elf's hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
