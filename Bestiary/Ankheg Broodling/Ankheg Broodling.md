### Actions

_**Bite.**_ Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. **Hit:** 10 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) acid damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the ankheg broodling can bite only the grappled creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.  
  
_**Acid Spray (Recharge 6).**_ The young ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 ft. long and 5 ft. wide, provided that it has no creature grappled. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (1d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
