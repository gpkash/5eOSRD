**Martial Advantage**. Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 10 (3d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't [[incapacitated]].

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The hobgoblin makes two greatsword attacks.

**Greatsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.

**Javelin**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. For 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is [[incapacitated]].
