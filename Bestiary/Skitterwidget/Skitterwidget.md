### Skitterwidget
_Medium construct, _

![[Skitterwidget.jpg]]

A skitterwidget is made of metal and bears a passing resemblance to a giant dog-headed cockroach. No two skitterwidgets look exactly alike, but all are surprisingly cute.

**Lightning Absorption**. Whenever the skitterwidget is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.

**Unusual Nature**. The skitterwidget doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The skitterwidget makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] by the skitterwidget (escape DC 13).

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn.

#### Reactions
**Good Parent**. The skitterwidget imposes disadvantage on one attack roll made against a kiddywidget it can see within 5 feet of it.
