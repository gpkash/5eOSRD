**Magic Resistance**. The yuan-ti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Innate Spellcasting (Abomination Form Only).** The yuan-ti's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). The yuan-ti can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
