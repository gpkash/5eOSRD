**Dwarven Resilience**. Augrek has advantage on saving throws against poison.

**Shapechanger**. If Zorak isn't in sunlight or running water, he can use his action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into his true form. While in bat form, Zorak can't speak, his walking speed is 5 feet, and he has a flying speed of 30 feet. His statistics, other than his size and speed, are unchanged. Anything he is wearing transforms with it, but nothing he is carrying does. He reverts to his true form if he dies. While in mist form, Zorak can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. He is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and he can't pass through water. He has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and he is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Zorak fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Misty Escape**. When he drops to 0 hit points outside his resting place, Zorak transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling [[unconscious]], provided that he isn't in sunlight or running water. If he can't transform, he is destroyed. While he has 0 hit points in mist form, he can't revert to his vampire form, and he must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in his resting place, he reverts to his vampire form. He is then [[paralyzed]] until he regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in his resting place with 0 hit points, he regains 1 hit point.

**Regeneration**. Zorak regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Zorak takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of Zorak's next turn.

**Spider Climb**. Zorak can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Vampire Weaknesses**. Zorak has the following flaws: [[Forbiddance.]] Zorak can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. [[Harmed by Running Water.]] Zorak takes 20 acid damage if he ends his turn in running water. [[Stake to the Heart.]] If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Zorak's heart while Zorak is [[incapacitated]] in his resting place, Zorak is [[paralyzed]] until the stake is removed. [[Sunlight Hypersensitivity.]] Zorak takes 20 radiant damage when he starts his turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, he has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Zorak makes two attacks with his [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Dwarven Thrower/Dwarven Thrower]], only one of which can be a ranged attack.

**Dwarven Thrower**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage, or 12 (1d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack. On a ranged attack that hits, the hammer deals an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage (2d8 if the target is a giant). [[Hit or Miss:]] If thrown, the weapon flies back to Zorak's hand after the attack.

**Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)**. Zorak makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

**Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Zorak can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

**Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is [[grappled]] by Zorak, [[incapacitated]], or [[restrained]]. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Zorak regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces his hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a [[vampire spawn]] under Zorak's control.

**Charm**. Zorak targets one humanoid he can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see Zorak, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be [[charmed]] by Zorak. The [[charmed]] target regards Zorak as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Zorak's control, it takes Zorak's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for Zorak's bite attack. Each time Zorak or Zorak's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Zorak is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

**Children of the Night (1/Day)**. Zorak magically calls 2d4 swarms of [[swarm of bats||bats]] or [[swarm of rats||rats]], provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, Zorak can call 3d6 [[wolf||wolves]] instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of Zorak and obeying his spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until Zorak dies, or until Zorak dismisses them as a bonus action.
