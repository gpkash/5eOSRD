**Death Burst**. When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of sticky mud. Each Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be [[restrained]] until the end of the creature's next turn.

**False Appearance**. While the mephit remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary mound of mud.

##### Actions
**Fists**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage.

**Mud Breath Recharge 6**. The mephit belches viscid mud onto one creature within 5 feet of it. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be [[restrained]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
