### Prismari Apprentice
_Small, Medium humanoid (sorcerer), any alignment_

![[Prismari Apprentice.webp]]

The students of Prismari College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—see no distinction between magic and art. No two Prismari students have the same style of spellcasting; each wields the elemental magic taught by the college in a way that expresses their personality. In the hands of Prismari students, spells that conjure fire or bend water to one's will become vibrant and expressive showcases, thrumming with creative energy.

Harnessing the elemental forces of their magic requires precision and grace, and some students dedicate themselves to chasing the ideal of perfect control, hoping that by doing so, they can accurately express what is churning within their minds.


**Prismari Scholars** The scholars of Prismari College believe that art is the truest form of spellcraft. They use magic to make splendid art, and they employ artistry to make their magic spectacular.
