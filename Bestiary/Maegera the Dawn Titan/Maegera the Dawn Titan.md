### Maegera the Dawn Titan
_Gargantuan elemental, chaotic evil_

![[Maegera the Dawn Titan token.png]]

Maegera is powerful elemental that has been trapped in the forges of Gauntlgrym for millennia. About fifty years ago, Maegera briefly escaped and triggered the eruption of Mount Hotenow. Lava from the volcano flowed toward the coast, laying waste to Neverwinter. The city is still rebuilding in the wake of that catastrophe.

The fire giant duke Zalto recently sent a team of drow to infiltrate Gauntlgrym and trap Maegera in an iron flask . Zalto needs the primordial to ignite an adamantine forge beneath the Ice Spires. Returning Maegera to Gauntlgrym is one way to thwart the fire giant's plans.

Maegera looks like a 50-foot-tall, multi-limbed beast made of flame, with smoldering black pits for eyes.

**Empowered Attacks**. Maegera's slam attacks are treated as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to damage from nonmagical attacks.

**Fire Aura**. At the start of each of Maegera's turns, each creature within 30 feet of it takes 35 (10d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature also takes 35 (10d6) fire damage from touching Maegera or from hitting it with a melee attack while within 10 feet of it, and a creature takes that damage the first time on a turn that Maegera moves into its space. Nonmagical weapons that hit Maegera are destroyed by fire immediately after dealing damage to it.

**Fire Form**. Maegera can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing if fire could pass through that space.

**Illumination**. Maegera sheds bright light in a 120-foot radius and dim light in an additional 120 ft..

**Magic Resistance**. Maegera has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spellcasting.** Maegera casts [[fireball]] (spell save DC 19), requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability.
