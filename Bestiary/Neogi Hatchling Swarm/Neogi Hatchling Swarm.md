### Neogi Hatchling Swarm
_Medium aberration, lawful evil_

![[Neogi Hatchling Swarm token.png]]

A neogi lives about a century. When an individual is rendered weak by advanced age, the other neogi in the group overpower it and inject it with a special poison. The toxin transforms the old neogi into a bloated mass of flesh. Younger neogi lay their eggs atop it, and when the hatchlings emerge, they devour the old neogi and one another until only a few of the strongest newborns are left. Sometimes the newborns, united by a singular evil purpose, coalesce into a skittering swarm instead.

**Spider Climb**. The swarm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Swarm**. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny neogi hatchling. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

##### Actions
**Swarm of Bites**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 22 (6d6 + 1) poison damage, or 11 (3d6 + 1) poison damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
