### Elkhorn
_Medium humanoid (dwarf), lawful good_

![[Elkhorn.webp]]

Elkhorn has been Strongheart's most stalwart companion over the yearsâ€”unflinchingly loyal, tirelessly optimistic, and fiercely devoted to the destruction of evil in all its forms. He's not especially bright, so he fights with his heart rather than his wits.

Age has drained much of the strength from Elkhorn's body. Strongheart has urged Elkhorn to retire, but the old dwarf stubbornly refuses to do so.
