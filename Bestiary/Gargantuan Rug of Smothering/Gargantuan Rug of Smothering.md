**Antimagic Susceptibility**. The rug is [[incapacitated]] while in the area of an [[antimagic field]]. If targeted by [[dispel magic]], the rug must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall [[unconscious]] for 1 minute.

**Damage Transfer**. While it is grappling a creature, the rug takes only half the damage dealt to it, and the creature [[grappled]] by the rug takes the other half.

**False Appearance**. While the rug remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal rug.

##### Actions
**Smother**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: The creature is [[grappled]] (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], [[blinded]], and at risk of suffocating, and the rug can't smother another target. In addition, at the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
