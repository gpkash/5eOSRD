**Spellcasting.** The sage casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks):

##### Actions
**Shocking Grasp (Cantrip)**. _Melee Spell Attack:_ +8 to hit (with advantage if the target is wearing armor made of metal), reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (3d8) lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Fireball (3rd-Level Spell; 3/Day)**. The sage creates a fiery explosion centered on a point it can see within 150 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

#### Reactions
**Shield (1st-Level Spell; 3/Day)**. When the sage is hit by an attack or targeted by a [[magic missile]] spell, it calls forth an [[invisible]] barrier of magical force that protects it. Until the start of its next turn, the sage has a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and it takes no damage from magic missile.
