**Amphibious**. The koalinth can breathe air and water.

**Martial Advantage**. Once per turn, the sergeant can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the sergeant that isn't [[incapacitated]].

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The sergeant makes two melee attacks with its trident.

**Trident**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Hooked Net**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 10/30 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, and the target is [[restrained]]. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check to free itself or another creature in a hooked net, ending the effect on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 12) frees the target without harming it and destroys the net.

#### Reactions
**Spear the Helpless (2/Day)**. Whenever a creature within 30 feet of the sergeant becomes [[restrained]], the sergeant can move its speed toward the [[restrained]] creature. If the sergeant ends its move within reach of the [[restrained]] creature, it can make a melee attack against it.
