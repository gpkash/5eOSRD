### Strongheart
_Medium humanoid (human, paladin), lawful good_

![[Strongheart.webp]]

Strongheart is a fearless seeker of justice, risking his life to ensure that good triumphs over evil. He is thoughtful, kind, and seldom rash, yet never hesitant to punish those who spit in the face of law and order.

Strongheart doesn't worship a god but devotes himself to an ideal: that the world can be spared from evil by those who have enough courage to stand against it.

Once on each of his turns, Strongheart can also cause the blade to gleam with holy light. If he does so, the target is [[blinded]] until the start of Strongheart's next turn.
