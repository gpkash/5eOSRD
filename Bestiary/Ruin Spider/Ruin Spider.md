### Ruin Spider
_Large monstrosity, unaligned_

![[Ruin Spider.jpg]]

The potent magic of a Deck of Many Things can have unpredictable effects on its environment, especially when the deck remains in one place for a long time.

Ruin spiders arise when the magic of the deck transforms giant spiders into even more dangerous monsters whose acidic venom disintegrates everything it touches. A ruin spider is easily recognizable by anyone familiar with the Deck of Many Things because the pattern on the back of the cards is duplicated on the spider's carapace.

**Ruinous Acid**. Any nonmagical weapon that hits the spider corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the spider is destroyed after dealing damage.

**Spider Climb**. The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Sense**. While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker**. The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The spider makes two Ruinous Bite attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Web.

**Ruinous Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) acid damage. In addition, if the target is a creature wearing nonmagical armor, the armor takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an Armor Class of 10 is destroyed.

**Web Recharge 5-6**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. Hit: The target has the [[restrained]] condition. As an action, a [[restrained]] target can make a DC 13 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a successful check. The webbing can also be destroyed (AC 10; 5 hit points; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to acid, bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
