**Death Burst**. When the mephit dies, it leaves behind a cloud of smoke that fills a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on its space. The sphere is heavily obscured. Wind disperses the cloud, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute.

**Innate Spellcasting (1/Day).** The mephit can innately cast [[dancing lights]], requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.

##### Actions
**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.

**Cinder Breath Recharge 6**. The mephit exhales a 15-foot cone of smoldering ash. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the end of the mephit's next turn.
