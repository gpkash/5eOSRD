**Dawnmartyr's Grace (1/[[Long Rest]])**. When Pike is reduced to 0 hit points while wearing the [[Plate of the Dawnmartyr (Exalted)|Plate of the Dawnmartyr]], she can choose to have a blast of healing flame surround her. She regains 1 hit point and is lifted to her feet. Each enemy within 10 feet of her takes 7 (2d6) fire damage or radiant damage (her choice).

If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throws or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes [[frightened]] of Pike until the end of her next turn.

**Guiding Bolt (5th Level)**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +11 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (8d6) radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against the target before the end of Pike's next turn has advantage.

#### Reactions

**Everlight's Guidance (3/[[Short Rest]])**. When Pike or a creature she can see within 30 feet of her makes an attack roll, she can grant a +10 bonus to the roll. She can grant this bonus after the roll is made but before it hits or misses.
