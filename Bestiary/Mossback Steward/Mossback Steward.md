### Mossback Steward
_Gargantuan monstrosity, unaligned_

![[Mossback Steward.webp]]

Desolate badlands and soggy marshes are home to the ancient and massive horizonback tortoises of Eastern Wynandir. Nearly fifty feet from nose to tail, and with a habit of remaining stationary for long periods, a horizonback tortoise is easy to mistake for a low hill at a distance. But when these impressive creatures rise to begin their march, the sight inspires fear and awe in equal parts. An omnivore of incredible size, these scavengers prefer to feed on dead vegetation, but make use of whatever edible matter they come across.

Medium or smaller creatures can move underneath the tortoise while it's not [[prone]]. Any creature under the tortoise when it falls [[prone]] is [[grappled]] (escape DC 18). Until the grapple ends, the creature is [[prone]] and [[restrained]].

**Shell Defense Recharge 4-6**. The tortoise withdraws into its shell, falls [[prone]], and gains a +5 bonus to AC. While the tortoise is in its shell, its speed is 0 and can't increase. The tortoise can emerge from its shell as an action, whereupon it is no longer [[prone]].
