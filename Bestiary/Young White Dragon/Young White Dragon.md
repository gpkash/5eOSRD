**Ice Walk**. The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, [[difficult terrain]] composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

**Cold Breath Recharge 5-6**. The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
