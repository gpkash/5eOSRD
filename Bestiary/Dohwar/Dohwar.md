### Dohwar
_Small fey, any alignment_

![[Dohwar.jpg]]

Dohwars are short, pudgy, flightless avians that look and move like penguins. Dohwars migrate from the Feywild to Wildspace, where they are typically encountered. They conduct their affairs in secrecy, preferring to meet in dark alleys and out-of-the-way places even when their business isn't illegal or dangerous. They tend to dress in a garish mishmash of clothing, but many of them also shroud themselves in hooded cloaks.

The average dohwar stands 3 feet tall and has bright plumage matching a particular color in the rainbow spectrum. This color can change at unpredictable times in the dohwar's life, often in response to the dohwar experiencing an overwhelming emotion. Instead of wings, it has arms and tiny hands.

Dohwars prefer to communicate through a form of telepathy they call merging, in which two dohwars stay in mental contact while both are telepathically linked with a third creature.
