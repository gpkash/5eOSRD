**Devil's Sight**. Magical darkness doesn't impede the abishai's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance**. The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. The abishai's weapon attacks are magical.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The abishai can use its Frightful Presence. It also makes three attacks: one with its morningstar, one with its claw, and one with its bite.

**Morningstar**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) piercing damage.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 38 (7d10) fire damage.

**Frightful Presence**. Each creature of the abishai's choice that is within 120 feet and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the abishai's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Incite Fanaticism**. The abishai chooses up to four of its allies within 60 feet of it that can see it. For 1 minute, each of those allies makes attack rolls with advantage and can't be [[frightened]].

**Power of the Dragon Queen**. The abishai targets one dragon it can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. A chromatic dragon makes this save with disadvantage. On a successful save, the target is immune to the abishai's Power of the Dragon Queen for 1 hour. On a failed save, the target is [[charmed]] by the abishai for 1 hour. While [[charmed]] in this way, the target regards the abishai as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect ends if the abishai or its companions deal damage to the target.
