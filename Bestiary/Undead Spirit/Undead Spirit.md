**Incorporeal Movement (Ghostly Only)**. The undead can become incorporeal while moving and pass through other creatures and objects as if they were [[difficult terrain]]. If it ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet traveled.

**Festering Aura (Putrid Only)**. Any creature, other than you, that starts its turn within 5 feet of the undead must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be [[poisoned]] until the start of its next turn.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The spirit makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down).

**Deathly Touch (Ghostly Only)**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1d8 + 3 + the spell's level necrotic damage, and the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be [[frightened]] of the undead until the end of the target's next turn.

**Grave Bolt (Skeletal Only)**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ your spell attack modifier to hit, range 150 ft., one target. Hit: 2d8 + 3 + the spell's level necrotic damage.

**Rotting Claw (Putrid Only)**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d6 + 3 + the spell's level slashing damage.
