### Flail Snail
_Large elemental, unaligned_

![[Flail Snail.webp]]

A flail snail is a creature of elemental earth that is prized for its multihued shell. It may seem harmless, but if a creature big enough to be a threat approaches too close, the snail flashes a scintillating light and attacks with its mace-like tentacles.

Left undisturbed, a flail snail moves slowly along the ground. It consumes everything on the surface, including rocks, sand, and soil, and it stops periodically to relish crystal growths and other large mineral deposits. It leaves behind a shimmering trail that quickly solidifies into a thin and nearly transparent layer. This glassy residue can be harvested and cut to form window panes. It can also be heated and spun into other glass objects. Some folk make a living from trailing flail snails to collect this glass.

**Using the Shell of a Flail Snail** A flail snail shell weighs about 250 pounds and has numerous uses. An intact shell can sell for 5,000 gp.

Many hunters seek the shell for its antimagic properties. A skilled armorer can make three shields from one shell. For 1 month, each shield gives its wielder the snail's Antimagic Shell trait. When the shield's magic fades, it becomes an exotic shield that is the perfect item from which to make a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic Items (old)/Spellguard Shield]].

A flail snail shell can also be used to make a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic Items (old)/Robe of Scintillating Colors]]. The shell is ground and added to the dye applied to the fabric. The powder is also a material component of the ritual that enchants the robe.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The flail snail makes as many flail tentacle attacks as it has flail tentacles, all against the same target.

**Flail Tentacle**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

**Scintillating Shell (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. The snail's shell emits dazzling, colored light until the end of the snail's next turn. During this time, the shell sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see the snail have disadvantage on attack rolls against it. In addition, any creature within the bright light and able to see the snail when this power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the light ends.

**Shell Defense**. The flail snail withdraws into its shell, gaining a +4 bonus to AC until it emerges. It can emerge from its shell as a bonus action on its turn.
