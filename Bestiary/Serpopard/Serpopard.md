**Keen Smell**. The serpopard has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Pounce**. If the serpopard moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]]. If the target is [[prone]], the serpopard can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

##### Actions
**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
