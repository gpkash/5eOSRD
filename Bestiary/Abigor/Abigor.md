**Devil's Sight**. Magical darkness doesn't impede Abigor's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance**. Abigor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Abigor makes four attacks using its Warhammer, Throwing Hammer, or a combination of the two.

**Warhammer**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) thunder damage.

**Throwing Hammer**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) thunder damage. Hammers thrown this way fall and stick into the ground after hitting their target and a new hammer appears in Abigor's hand.

**Thunderous Slam Recharge 5-6**. Abigor causes all its hammers left on the battlefield to bristle with thunderous energy, exploding outwards with a roar. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on each hammer must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. Targets take 26 (4d12) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature is within multiple spheres, it must make the save multiple times, taking damage from each source.
