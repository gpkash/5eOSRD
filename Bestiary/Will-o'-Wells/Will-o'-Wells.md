**Consume Life**. As a bonus action, the will-o'-wisp can target one creature it can see within 5 feet of it that has 0 hit points and is still alive. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw against this magic or die. If the target dies, the will-o'-wisp regains 10 (3d6) hit points.

**Ephemeral**. The will-o'-wisp can't wear or carry anything.

**Incorporeal Movement**. The will-o'-wisp can move through other creatures and objects as if they were [[difficult terrain]]. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Variable Illumination**. The will-o'-wisp sheds bright light in a 5 to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of ft. equal to the chosen radius. The will-o'-wisp can alter the radius as a bonus action.

##### Actions
**Shock**. _Melee Spell Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d8) lightning damage.

**Invisibility**. The will-o'-wisp and its light magically become [[invisible]] until it attacks or uses its Consume Life, or until its [[concentration]] ends (as if [[concentration||concentrating]] on a spell).
