**Undead Fortitude**. If damage reduces the skeletal knight to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is bludgeoning or from a critical hit. On a success, the skeletal knight drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Unusual Nature**. The skeletal knight doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Enervating Blade**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) necrotic damage, and if the target is a creature, it can't regain hit points until the start of the skeletal knight's next turn.

**Throwing Axe**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.
