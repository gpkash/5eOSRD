**Keen Hearing**. The whale has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The whale makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the whale. A swallowed creature has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the whale, and it takes 3 (1d6) acid damage at the start of each of the whale's turns. If the whale takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the whale must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the whale. If the whale dies, a swallowed creature can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage, or 37 (6d6 + 16) bludgeoning damage if the target is an object.
