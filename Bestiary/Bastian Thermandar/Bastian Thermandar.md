### Bastian Thermandar
_Medium humanoid (Fire genasi), neutral evil_

![[Bastian Thermandar token.png]]

Like many in the fire cult, Bastian burns with an inner fire, but his fire is ambition, rather than a wish to see the world burn. Bastian is scheming to supplant Vanifer and claim Tinderstrike for himself.

As a practitioner of the arcane arts who learned much of his fire magic from Vanifer herself, Bastian relies on his spells in a fight, and he is a "quick-burning" sort who tries to deliver maximum impact early in the fight. If he knows a fight is coming but can't preemptively strike, Bastian becomes more cautious, casting wall of fire to protect himself before he hurls magic into the fray.
