**Creature Sense**. The elder brain is aware of creatures within 1 mile of itself that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each one's Intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a [[mind blank]] spell, a [[nondetection]] spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.

**Magic Resistance**. The elder brain has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Telepathic Hub**. The elder brain can use its telepathy to initiate and maintain telepathic conversations with up to ten creatures at a time. The elder brain can let those creatures telepathically hear each other while connected in this way.

**Spellcasting (Psionics).** The elder brain casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The elder brain makes two Tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 14) and takes 9 (1d8 + 5) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns until the grapple ends. The elder brain can have up to four targets [[grappled]] at a time.

**Mind Blast Recharge 5-6**. Creatures of the elder brain's choice within 60 feet of itself must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or take 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage and have the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute. A [[stunned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
