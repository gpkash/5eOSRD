**Amphibious**. The grung can breathe air and water.

**Poisonous Skin**. Any creature that grapples the grung or otherwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A [[poisoned]] creature no longer in direct contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Standing Leap**. The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

##### Actions
**Dagger**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) poison damage.

**Shortbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) poison damage.

**Mesmerizing Chirr Recharge 6**. The grung makes a chirring noise to which grungs are immune. Each humanoid or beast that is within 15 feet of the grung and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of the grung's next turn.
