**Innate Spellcasting.** The giant's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The giant makes two greatsword attacks.

**Greatsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (6d6 + 9) slashing damage.

**Rock**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (4d12 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

**Lightning Strike Recharge 5-6**. The giant hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point it can see within 500 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
