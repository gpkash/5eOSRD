### Kostchtchie
_Large fiend (demon), chaotic evil_

![[Kostchtchie.jpg]]

The demon lord Kostchtchie resembles a squat hill giant with short, bandy legs and a grossly shaped head.

Frost giants who forsake their gods and turn to demon worship can summon Kostchtchie with bloody offerings left on altars of hewn ice. If the demon lord chooses to answer the giants' call, he hunts and fights alongside them for a time, infecting the frost giants with savage madness and bloodlust before disappearing back to the Abyss.
