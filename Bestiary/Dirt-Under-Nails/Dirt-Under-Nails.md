**Dark One's Own Luck (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. When the warlock makes an ability check or saving throw, it can add a d10 to the roll. It can do this after the roll is made but before any of the roll's effects occur.

**Regeneration**. Dirt-Under-Nails regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn if he is in contact with the ground. If Dirt-Under-Nails takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Dirt-Under-Nails dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Special Equipment (+2 Rod of the Pact Keeper)**. While holding this [[+2 Rod of the Pact Keeper||rod]], Dirt-Under-Nails gains a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of his warlock spells (included in modifications, below). In addition, he can regain 1 warlock spell slot as an action while holding the rod. He can't use this property again until he finishes a long rest.

**Tree Stride**. Once on each of its turns, Dirt-Under-Nails can use 10 feet of his movement to step magically into one copse of mushrooms within 5 feet of him and emerge from a second copse of mushrooms within 60 feet of it, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second copse. Both copses of mushrooms must be Large or bigger. Dirt-Under-Nails doesn't need to be able to see the second copse to use this ability.
