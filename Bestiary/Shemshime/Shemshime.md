**Crushing End**. If damage reduces Shemshime to 0 hit points, Shemshime instead drops to 1 hit point unless the damage is the result of Shemshime being crushed by an object weighing at least 1,000 pounds.

**Incorporeal Movement**. Shemshime can move through other creatures and objects as if they were [[difficult terrain]]. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

##### Actions
**Maddening Touch**. _Melee Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) psychic damage.

**Whispers of Violence**. Shemshime chooses up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or that target takes 7 (1d8 + 3) psychic damage and must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature it can reach (Shemshime's choice) that Shemshime can see.

**Howling Babble Recharge 6**. Shemshime targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 21 (4d8 + 3) psychic damage and is [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [[stunned]].
