**Fey Step Recharge 4-6**. As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Joyful Presence**. Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[charmed]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Joyful Presence for 24 hours. Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the [[charmed]] creature, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Magic Resistance**. The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The eladrin's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
