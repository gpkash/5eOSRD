### Oinoloth
_Medium fiend (yugoloth), neutral evil_

![[Oinoloth.webp]]

Grim specters of death, oinoloths bring pestilence wherever they go. When armies recognize their awful forms, their mere appearance causes soldiers to break ranks and flee, lest they succumb to one of the awful plagues that oinoloths let loose.

Oinoloths solve thorny problems by killing everyone involved. They are typically hired as a last resort when a siege has gone on too long or an army has proven too strong to overcome. Once summoned, oinoloths stalk the killing field, poisoning the ground and sickening creatures they encounter. Sometimes they might be hired to lift the very plagues they spread, but the price for such work is high, and the effort turns the creatures they save into debilitated wrecks.

**Bringer of Plagues Recharge 5-6**. As a bonus action, the oinoloth blights the area within 30 feet of it. The blight lasts for 24 hours. While blighted, all normal plants in the area wither and die, and the number of hit points restored by a spell to a creature in that area is halved. Furthermore, when a creature moves into the blighted area or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the oinoloth's Bringer of Plagues for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and is [[poisoned]]. The [[poisoned]] creature can't regain hit points. After every 24 hours that elapse, the [[poisoned]] creature can repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). This reduction lasts until the poison ends, and the target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. The poison ends after the creature successfully saves against it three times.

**Magic Resistance**. The oinoloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. The oinoloth's weapon attacks are magical.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The oinoloth's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The oinoloth uses its Transfixing Gaze and makes two claw attacks.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 22 (4d10) necrotic damage.

**Corrupted Healing Recharge 6**. The oinoloth touches one willing creature within 5 feet of it. The target regains all its hit points. In addition, the oinoloth can end one disease on the target or remove one of the following conditions from it: [[blinded]], [[deafened]], [[paralyzed]], or [[poisoned]]. The target then gains 1 level of [[exhaustion]], and its hit point maximum is reduced by 7 (2d6). This reduction can be removed only by a [[wish]] spell or by casting [[greater restoration]] on the target three times within the same hour. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

**Teleport**. The oinoloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Transfixing Gaze**. The oinoloth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be [[charmed]] until the end of the oinoloth's next turn. While [[charmed]] in this way, the target is [[restrained]]. If the target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the oinoloth's gaze for the next 24 hours.
