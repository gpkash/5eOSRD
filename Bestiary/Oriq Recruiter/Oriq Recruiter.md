### Oriq Recruiter
_Medium humanoid (warlock), lawful evil_

![[Oriq Recruiter.webp]]

Oriq recruiters are subtle mages who infiltrate Strixhaven in service to their order. They are adept at blending in, watching for powerful but underperforming mages and students who have fallen through the cracks of the institution. The recruiters approach and befriend these individuals either as potential recruits to the Oriq or as assets who can help the Oriq acquire spells, rare spell components, or knowledge from Strixhaven.


**Oriq** The Oriq are a secret society of mages who wield forbidden magic in the service of their leader, Extus Narr. Narr was in consideration for elevation to the role of Oracle of Strixhaven, but when the Founder Dragons passed him over in favor of Jadzi, his bitterness knew no bounds. He now uses the Oriq to gather the spells and magical energy he needs to summon a devastating being, the Blood Avatar, to destroy Strixhaven.

The Oriq work in secret, infiltrating Strixhaven to search for the magic their master covets and watch for impressionable students and embittered faculty they might turn to their cause. The Oriq take pains to hide their true allegiance and wear masks to hide their identities. These masks have magical properties that function only for their intended wearers.
