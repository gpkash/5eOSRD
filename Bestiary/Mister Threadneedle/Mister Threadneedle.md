**False Appearance**. While the scarecrow remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary, inanimate scarecrow.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The scarecrow makes two claw attacks.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] until the end of the scarecrow's next turn.

**Terrifying Glare**. The scarecrow targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the scarecrow, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [[frightened]] until the end of the scarecrow's next turn. The [[frightened]] target is [[paralyzed]].
