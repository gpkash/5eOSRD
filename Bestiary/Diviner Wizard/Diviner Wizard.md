**Spellcasting.** The diviner casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The diviner makes three Arcane Burst attacks.

**Arcane Burst**. _Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) radiant damage.

**Overwhelming Revelation Recharge 5-6**. The diviner magically creates a burst of illumination in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage and is [[stunned]] until the end of the diviner's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[stunned]].

#### Reactions
**Portent (3/Day)**. When the diviner or a creature it can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the diviner rolls a d20 and chooses whether to use that roll in place of the d20 rolled for the attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.
