### Giant Zombie Constrictor Snake
_Huge undead, neutral evil_

![[Giant Zombie Constrictor Snake token.png]]

These enormous, rotten husks were living, Medium-sized constrictors when the yuan-ti brought them to honor and entice Kyrilla to share her knowledge and powers. They grew to their full, Huge size on a diet of supplicants and prisoners, many of whose bones can be found elsewhere in the lair. When the yuan-ti turned against Kyrilla, they fought and slew these snakesâ€”only to find them slithering again through cursed, ambient magic in Kyrilla's lair.

The constrictors die if they leave the lair.

**Sunlight Vulnerability**. While in sunlight, the snake has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. When the snake begins its turn in sunlight, it immediately suffers 10 radiant damage.

**Undead Fortitude**. If damage reduces the snake to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the snake drops to 1 hit point instead.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The snake makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with a constrict attack.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Constrict**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the creature is [[restrained]] and the snake cannot constrict another target.
