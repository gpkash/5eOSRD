**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence**. Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Lightning Breath Recharge 5-6**. The dragon exhales lightning in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 (16d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

##### Legendary Actions
**Detect**. The dragon makes a Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check.

**Tail Attack**. The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**. The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [[prone]]. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
