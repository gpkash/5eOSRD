### Dragonflesh Grafter
_Large monstrosity, neutral evil_

![[Dragonflesh Grafter.jpg]]

An ordinary dragonflesh grafter is a hulking fusion of draconic and bipedal characteristics, standing between 8 and 12 feet tall. As its original nature wanes, its draconic powers grow, giving it a thick layer of dragon scale armor that covers the grafted areas of its body. A dragonflesh grafter can belch forth a gout of corrosive acid in a mockery of dragon breath.

As a universal effect of their experimentation, grafters become obsessed with treasure. Their greed compels them to gather any gold or gems they can. After taking this treasure back to their lairs, they gaze for hours on end at their glittering trinkets and golden baubles.


**Dragonflesh Grafters** Dragonflesh grafters practice forbidden rituals and risky experiments on themselves, modifying their bodies and minds to emulate the dragons they revere. They collect dragon parts—scales, teeth, skin, flesh, wings, and bones—that they scavenge from around dragon lairs, take from dragon corpses, or buy from merchants and adventurers. They stitch on, implant, or ingest these dragon parts, attempting to incorporate them into their own bodies and absorb the latent magic that lingers in a draconic corpse.

While most would-be grafters wind up hideously scarred or dead, a few survive as wretched horrors. Their minds become twisted by magical malevolence, with only a shadow of their former selves remaining. In the most extreme cases, the resulting abomination holds no remnant of the person it once was and is utterly ruled by a dragon's lust for treasure.
