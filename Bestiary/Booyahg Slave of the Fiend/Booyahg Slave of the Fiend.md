**Dark One's Own Luck (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. When the warlock makes an ability check or saving throw, it can add a d10 to the roll. It can do this after the roll is made but before any of the roll's effects occur.

**Spellcasting.** The warlock casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15): 

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The warlock makes three Scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.

**Hellfire**. Green flame explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 120 feet of the warlock. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) fire damage and 11 (2d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Reactions
**Fiendish Rebuke (3/Day)**. In response to being damaged by a visible creature within 60 feet of it, the warlock forces that creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
