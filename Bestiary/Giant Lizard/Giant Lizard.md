A giant lizard can be ridden or used as a draft animal. Lizardfolk also keep them as pets, and subterranean giant lizards are used as mounts and pack animals by drow, duergar, and other Underdark dwellers.

**Variant: Giant Lizard Traits** Some giant lizards have one or both of the following traits.

**Hold Breath** The lizard can hold its breath for 15 minutes. (A lizard that has this trait also has a swimming speed of 30 feet.)


**Spider Climb** The lizard can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
