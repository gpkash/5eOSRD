**Spellcasting.** The abjurer casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The abjurer makes three Arcane Burst attacks.

**Arcane Burst**. _Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) force damage.

**Force Blast**. Each creature in a 20-foot cube originating from the abjurer must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8) force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the abjurer. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

#### Reactions
**Arcane Ward Recharge 4-6**. When the abjurer or a creature it can see within 30 feet of it takes damage, the abjurer magically creates a protective barrier around itself or the other creature. The barrier reduces the damage to the protected creature by 26 (4d10 + 4), to a minimum of 0, and then vanishes.
