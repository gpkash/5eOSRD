**Immutable Existence**. The servant is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form or send it to another plane of existence.

**Magic Resistance**. The servant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks made against it have disadvantage.

**Regeneration**. The servant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, this trait doesn't function until an attuned creature spends 24 hours repairing the artifact or until the artifact is subjected to lightning damage.

**Standing Leap**. The servant's long jump is up to 50 feet and its high jump is up to 25 feet, with or without a running start.

**Unusual Nature**. The servant doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

##### Actions
**Destructive Fist**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10) force damage. Or Ranged Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10) force damage. If the target is an object, it takes triple damage.

**Crushing Leap**. If the servant jumps at least 25 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures is pushed to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the servant and must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 26 (4d12) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[prone]]. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[prone]].
