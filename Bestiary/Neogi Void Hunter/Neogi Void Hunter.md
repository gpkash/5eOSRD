### Neogi Void Hunter
_Medium aberration (warlock), lawful evil_

![[Neogi Void Hunter token.png]]

A neogi void hunter is bigger than a typical adult neogi and often fills the role of captain aboard a nightspider (see the [[Astral Adventurer's Guide]]). The void hunter pledges fealty to one or more stellar entities in exchange for a taste of their immense power. These entities—known by such names as Acamar, Caiphon, Gibbeth, and Hadar—resemble stars and embody the essence of evil.

**Devil's Sight**. Magical darkness doesn't impede the neogi's darkvision.

**Mental Fortitude**. The neogi has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]], and magic can't put the neogi to sleep.

**Spider Climb**. The neogi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Spellcasting.** The neogi casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The neogi makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it makes two Eldritch Bolt attacks.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
