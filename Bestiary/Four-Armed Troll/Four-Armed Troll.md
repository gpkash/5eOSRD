### Four-Armed Troll
_Large giant, chaotic evil_

![[Four-Armed Troll.webp]]

Sometimes when a troll loses a limb, it regenerates two limbs to replace the one it lost. This can result in trolls with multiple arms. A four-armed troll uses the troll stat block, except that it is a Challenge Rating 6 monster (2,300 XP) and has alternate action options to suit.
