### Space Eel
_Small beast, unaligned_

![[Space Eel.webp]]

Space eels avoid confrontations with larger creatures unless the eels are starving. These 5-foot-long scavengers might trail a spelljamming ship and feed on barnacles they detach from the ship's hull. Wildspace hunters try to catch and kill the eels for their meatâ€”a task easier to describe than to accomplish.

**Unusual Nature**. The eel doesn't require air.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. If it isn't attached to a creature, the eel makes one Bite attack and one Tail Spine attack.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the eel attaches to the target. While attached, the eel can't make Bite attacks. Instead, the target takes 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage at the start of each of the eel's turns. The eel can detach itself as a bonus action. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the eel.

**Tail Spine**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is [[paralyzed]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
