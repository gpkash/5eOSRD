### Githyanki Star Seer
_Medium humanoid (gith, warlock), any alignment_

![[Githyanki Star Seer.webp]]

Githyanki star seers believe that the stars are the eyes of the multiverse. They use their magic to contact ancient stellar entities such as Acamar, Caiphon, and Hadar, hoping to learn their secrets, then record these secrets in journals. They scour Wildspace in search of new entities as well, hoping to be the first to contact them.

Some of the secrets learned are so cryptic that they require years of research to decipher, but time is of little concern to a star seer, who resides mainly on the Astral Plane.
