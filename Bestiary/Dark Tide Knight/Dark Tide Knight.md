### Dark Tide Knight
_Medium humanoid (human), lawful evil_

![[Dark Tide Knight.webp]]

Dark Tide knights are the elite warriors of the Crushing Wave cult. By drawing upon Olhydra's dark power, they gain the ability to ride sea-creatures that normally wouldn't be suitable as mounts, and can even breathe underwater and share their mount's senses. The knights prefer to fight from or in the water, since they don't like to leave their mounts behind, but they can be fierce opponents on foot at need.

Unlike most other knights, Dark Tide knights disdain heavy armor, relying on the speed and ferocity of their attacks to carry them to victory.

**Bonded Mount**. The knight is magically bound to a beast with an innate swimming speed trained to serve as its mount. While mounted on this beast, the knight gains the beast's senses and ability to breathe underwater. The bonded mount obeys the knight's commands. If its mount dies, the knight can train a new beast to serve as its bonded mount, a process requiring a month.

**Sneak Attack**. The knight deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the knight that isn't [[incapacitated]] and the knight doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The knight makes two shortsword attacks.

**Shortsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Lance**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d12 + 3) piercing damage.

#### Reactions
**Uncanny Dodge**. When an attacker the knight can see hits it with an attack, the knight can halve the damage against it.
