### Intellect Snare
_Small aberration, neutral evil_

![[Intellect Snare.webp]]

When the strange horrors of the Far Realm rip at the minds of individuals, some of those wayward shreds of thought conglomerate to form an intellect snare. An intellect snare appears as a writhing ball of tentacles, echoing with the cacophonous sounds of every thought the snare has consumed.

Intellect snares are scavengers, often found scouring the aftermath of a mind flayer attack to feast on whatever hapless creatures are left behind. An intellect snare feeds by wrapping a creature in one of its tentacles and then siphoning shreds of thought, leaving a tattered mind in its wake.
