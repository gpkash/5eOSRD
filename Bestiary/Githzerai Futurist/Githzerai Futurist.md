### Githzerai Futurist
_Medium aberration (gith), any alignment_

![[Githzerai Futurist.webp]]

Githzerai futurists have transcended their limits through focused meditation and can now catch glimpses of the future. They foresee the possible outcomes of battles, using those portents to tilt the balance in their favor.


**Githzerai** Githzerai descend from an ancient people who were also the progenitors of the githyankiâ€”all of whom were destroyed or transformed by mind flayers. Many githzerai dwell in Limbo, honing their psionic powers by shaping their homes on that chaotic plane. The githzerai described here oftentimes traverse the planes, crossing between them via the portals in Sigil and the Outlands. To learn more about other githzerai, see the[[Monster Manual]].

**Psychic Defense**. While the githzerai is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

**Spellcasting (Psionics).** The githzerai casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The githzerai makes three Unarmed Strike or Psychic Bolt attacks.

**Unarmed Strike**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) psychic damage.

**Psychic Bolt**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 (4d8 + 3) psychic damage.

#### Reactions
**Future Insight (3/Day)**. When the githzerai or a creature it can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the githzerai can cause the roll to be made with advantage or disadvantage.
