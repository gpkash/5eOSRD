![[Scholarly Mastermind.webp]]

Scholarly masterminds are the formidable leaders of academic research organizations, responsible for planning and carrying out operations that delve into the secrets of the past. Some masterminds are headmasters at academies or universities. Others operate individually and in secret, pursuing agendas that might diverge wildly from those of the rest of their organization.


**Scholars of Allsight** The Allegiance of Allsight is a scholarly faction that operates primarily within the Marquesian metropolis of Ank'Harel. Though most members of the allegiance are academics unfamiliar with combat, the faction's field agents are skilled archaeologists who are also trained to contend with and overcome the threats that lurk in the depths of Exandria.
