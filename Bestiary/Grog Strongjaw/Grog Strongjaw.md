**Brutal Critical**. When Grog scores a critical hit, he rolls double weapon damage dice as usual, then rolls 3 additional weapon damage dice.

**Feral Instinct**. Grog has advantage on initiative rolls.

**Melee Master**. Grog can take a âˆ’5 penalty to any melee attack roll to gain a +10 bonus to the damage roll.

**Reckless**. At the start of his turn, Grog can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against him have advantage until the start of his next turn.

**Relentless Rage**. If Grog is reduced to 0 hit points while raging, he drops to 1 hit point instead if he succeeds on a DC 10 Constitution saving throws.

**Special Equipment**. Grog wears a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic Items (old)/Belt of Dwarvenkind]]. He wields the [[Bloodaxe|EGW]] (a +2 magic weapon), a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Dwarven Thrower/Dwarven Thrower]], and the [[Titanstone Knuckles (Exalted)|Titanstone Knuckles]].

**Spellbreaker**. When Grog damages a creature that is concentrating on a spell, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throws to maintain its [[concentration]]. In addition, Grog has advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creatures within 5 feet of him.

**Toughness**. Grog has an additional 40 hit points.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Grog makes two attacks (three when raging) with his [[Bloodaxe|EGW]], [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Dwarven Thrower/Dwarven Thrower]], or [[Titanstone Knuckles (Exalted)|Titanstone Knuckles]].

**[[Bloodaxe|EGW]]**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (1d12 + 14) slashing damage and 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points, Grog gains 10 temporary hit points.

**[[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Dwarven Thrower/Dwarven Thrower]]**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60, one target. Hit: 24 (2d8 + 15) bludgeoning damage.

**Titanstone Knuckles**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (1d4 + 12) bludgeoning damage.

**Enlarge (Recharges after a [[Long Rest]])**. Grog casts [[enlarge/reduce]] on himself to grow in size for 10 minutes. While enlarged in this way, he has resistance to cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage.

#### Reactions
**Opportunist**. When a creature within 5 feet of Grog casts a spell or deals damage to him, Grog can make a melee weapon attack against that creature.
