### Bakunawa
_Gargantuan dragon, neutral_

![[Bakunawa.webp]]

Worshiped as draconic avatars of storm and tide, bakunawa soar over the archipelagos they call home. Iridescent scales crackling with lightning cover a bakunawa's fearsome serpentine body, and the sharp movements of its mighty wings echo with thunderous winds. Known for their mercilessness in battle, bakunawa swallow whole any who challenge them.

**Amphibious**. The bakunawa can breathe air and water.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If the bakunawa fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The bakunawa makes one Bite attack and one Storm Slam attack.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the bakunawa. A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], and it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the bakunawa. At the start of each of the bakunawa's turns, each swallowed creature takes 10 (3d6) lightning damage. The bakunawa's gullet can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the bakunawa takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a swallowed creature, the bakunawa must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 15 feet of the bakunawa. If the bakunawa dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].

**Storm Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (1d10) thunder damage, and the target is pushed up to 10 feet in a horizontal direction away from the bakunawa.
