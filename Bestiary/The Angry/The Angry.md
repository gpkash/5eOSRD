### The Angry
_Medium monstrosity, lawful evil_

![[The Angry.webp]]

**The Angry** Relying on violence to sustain their existence, the Angry grow more powerful when their foes fight back. If a creature opts not to attack, though, the Angry becomes confused, and its attacks weaken. Each of the Angry has two heads, which bicker with each other until they find something else on which they can vent their wrath.

**Sorrowsworn** The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. The sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering that are inherent to the shadowy landscape, and they visit horror on those who stumble into their midst.

**Emotion Given Form** Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress. Some are manifestations of anger; others are loneliness given physical form. Their nature provides a clue both to understanding how they become more powerful and to overcoming them. Giving in to the negative emotions that the sorrowsworn represent causes these entities to grow deadlier. Fighting against these emotions can weaken them and drive them away.

##### Lore

History DC 15: Some who wander the shadowfell seek a sort of refuge from the misery in resentment, externalizing and personifying their impassive tormentor as a way of reckoning with it. Sadly this is no escape, as anger worms as deep as any other of the shadowfells cruel medicants.

Nature DC 20: The angry require perpetual conflict, desperate for an enemy so they do not have to confront themselves. Those who deny them that outlet find the strength of their assailant much diminished.

##### Tactics

The angry first attacks the nearest foe, and thereafter whichever foe harmed it most recently, happily provoking attacks of opportunity to gain the Maddened damage bonus on as many of its attacks as possible, and to provoke its Vicious Outburst. If it starts its turn Seething or Enraged, it uses its Shrieking Charge instead of its multiattack.

If its enemies begin exploiting its pacifism weakness in earnest, it dashes on each of its turns, fleeing as best as it is able.
