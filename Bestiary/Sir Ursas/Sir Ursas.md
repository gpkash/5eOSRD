### Sir Ursas
_Medium humanoid (human), lawful evil_

![[Sir Ursas token.png]]

**Out on Loan** The powerful relics possessed by Lynx Creatlach and Sir Ursas (see the "Special Equipment" section of their stat blocks) have been granted to them by their diabolical masters, and are not meant to be claimed as treasure. If either agent is killed in the course of the adventure, their special equipment vanishes, returning to Bel or Zariel.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Sir Ursas makes three melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

**Spear**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. and range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
