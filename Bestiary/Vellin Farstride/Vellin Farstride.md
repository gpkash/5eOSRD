Vellin Farstride has earned his last name with a travelogue that would be the envy of any would-be explorer. Vellin specializes in hunting fiendish enemies and other extra planar threats. Vellin is almost always accompanied by his faithful wolf, Akela, and often rides the beast into battle.

Originally from the world of Oerth, Vellin arrived in Faerûn several years ago. Between those two worlds Vellin traveled the Astral Sea, hunted demons in the Blood War, dealt with hags in the Gray Waste and assassinated Infernal Dukes on Avernus. Vellin quickly fell in love with the vast and beautiful wilds of Faerûn and decided that it would be his home. In order to protect his new home, Vellin wanted to band together with formidable allies that could protect it from outer planar threats. He discovered that the Harpers had values that were closest to his own.

Vellin is adept at diplomacy and deception, out of necessity from having to deal with Fiendish powers. Though not physically intimidating, his quiet intensity and well-earned confidence can be very convincing. He prefers simple and direct language, even when dealing with nobles and royalty, but can employ eloquence and flattery when the need arises.

**Vellin as a Contact** Vellin is the primary contact for members of the Harpers at low levels. Vellin is an expert at obtaining mounts on short notice for those who need to get somewhere quickly. Each member of your group gets access to the type of mount requested. If any of the mounts die while under your control (or a member of your group), you can never use that type of mount again. Otherwise, you can use the mount as long as needed.
