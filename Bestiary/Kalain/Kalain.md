**Fey Ancestry**. Kalain has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] and magic can't put her to sleep.

**Art Imitates Life (3/Day)**. Kalain touches one of her paintings and causes its subject to spring forth, becoming a creature of that kind provided its CR is 3 or lower. The creature appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the painting, which becomes blank. The creature is friendly toward Kalain and hostile toward all others. It rolls initiative to determine when it acts. It disappears after 1 minute, when it is reduced to 0 hit points, or when Kalain dies or falls [[unconscious]].

**Taunt (2/Day)**. Kalain can use a bonus action on her turn to target one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear Kalain, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of Kalain's next turn.

Cantrips (at will): [[friends]], [[mage hand]], [[vicious mockery]]

2nd level (3 slots): [[invisibility]], [[shatter]]
