### Ramius
_Medium humanoid, neutral good_

![[Ramius.webp]]

Ramius Dangremond is the commander of the Hellriders of Elturel. He never wanted the position, but because of the many deaths within the ranks of the order, he had to step up. His friend and fellow Hellrider, Barachiel, was the main reason he was able to grow into a capable commander. The loss of his friend saddens Ramius, and the news of his imprisonment within the Nine Hells gnaws at his soul.

Ramius is a natural horseman and a gifted athlete. The soldiers he leads often say that there isn't anything that Ramius can't mount or ride. He's ridden horses, mammoths, and machines into battle. Loyalty, honor, and duty are virtues that Ramius upholds. He fears nothing other than losing those he cares for.

**Spellcasting.** Ramius casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Ramius makes two Longsword attacks.

**Longsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d8 + 6) slashing damage or 11 ([[1d10 + 6) if wielded in two hands, plus 13 (3d8) radiant damage. If the target is an evil creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or take an additional 13 (3d8) radiant damage.

**Divine Wave Recharge 6**. Ramius strikes the ground and causes holy energy to radiate outwards. Each creature of his choice within 30 feet of him must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.
