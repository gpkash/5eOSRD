**Cavalry Training**. When the duergar hits a target with a melee attack while mounted on a female steeder, the steeder can make one melee attack against the same target as a reaction.

**Duergar Resilience**. The duergar has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being [[charmed]] or [[paralyzed]].

**Sunlight Sensitivity**. While in sunlight, the duergar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The duergar makes two war pick attacks.

**War Pick**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage.

**Heavy Crossbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d10) piercing damage.

**Shared Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. The duergar magically turns [[invisible]] for up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it casts a spell, or its [[concentration]] is broken (as if [[concentration||concentrating]] on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is [[invisible]] with it. While the [[invisible]] duergar is mounted on a female steeder, the steeder is [[invisible]] as well. The invisibility ends early on the steeder immediately after it attacks.
