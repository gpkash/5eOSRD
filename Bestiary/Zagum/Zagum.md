**Contractually Obligated**. Zagum has advantage to hit creatures under an infernal contract and when he hits such creatures he delivers an additional 9 (2d8) damage of a type the target is most vulnerable to. A creature bound under an infernal contract also makes all saving throws against effects originating from Zagum with disadvantage.

**Devil's Sight**. Magical darkness doesn't impede Zagum's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance**. Zagum has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Zagum makes three attacks with Disarming Tongue or Oration.

**Disarming Tongue**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d4 + 3) slashing damage. A target hit by this attack has vulnerability to psychic damage until the start of their next turn.

**Oration**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +14 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (6d8 + 8) psychic damage.

**Legal Jargon Recharge 4-6**. Zagum chooses a point he can see within 90 feet of him. All creatures within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. Creatures that fail the save are confused for up to 1 minute and must roll a d10 at the start of each of their turns. On a 1, a creature moves in a random direction then ends their turn. On a 2-6, a creature can't use actions this turn. On a 7-8, a creature must use their action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within their reach that is not a Fiend. On a 9-10, a creature can move and act normally. A confused creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.
