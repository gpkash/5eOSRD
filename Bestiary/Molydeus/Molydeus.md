### Molydeus
_Huge fiend (demon), chaotic evil_

![[Molydeus.jpg]]

The fearsome molydeus speaks for the demon lord it serves and enforces its master's will. This demon is 12 feet tall, and its bipedal body has a slavering wolfs head and a fanged serpent's head. Its demon lord can speak and see through the serpent head; this master also uses the molydeus to guard treasures, slay foes, and terrify troops into obedience.

A molydeus's demon lord bestows on it a powerful weapon that dissolves if the molydeus dies. The weapon's form varies depending on the creator, but that doesn't affect the weapon's capabilities.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The molydeus makes three attacks: one with its weapon, one with its wolf bite, and one with its snakebite.

**Demonic Weapon**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) slashing damage. If the target has at least one head and the molydeus rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.

**Wolf Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) piercing damage.

**Snakebite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (1d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target transforms into a [[manes]] if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This transformation can be ended only by a [[wish]] spell.
