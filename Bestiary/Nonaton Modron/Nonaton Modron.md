### Nonaton Modron
_Large construct, lawful neutral_

![[Nonaton Modron.webp]]

When modrons act against the will of Primus, nonatons are charged with bringing those rogue units into line. These inspectors also interrogate captured trespassers of Mechanus. Nonatons have wormlike bodies studded with nine mechanical arms.


**Modrons** Constructed on the plane of Mechanus, modrons are partially mechanical beings that belong to a strict hierarchy. Each modron dutifully obeys commands from the rank directly above it and in turn acts as the superior to the rank directly below it, passing down commands from paragons of law to the lowliest monodrone. While most modrons are the lower-ranked base modrons—monodrones, duodrones, tridrones, quadrones, and pentadrones—the upper-tier hierarch modrons hold leadership positions, maintaining order in Mechanus and the realms beyond. For more information on modrons, see the[[Monster Manual]].

**Axiomatic Mind**. The nonaton can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

**Combat Ready**. The nonaton has advantage on initiative rolls.

**Disintegration**. If the nonaton dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind anything it was carrying.

**Spellcasting.** The nonaton casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The nonaton makes three Arm attacks and uses Pillar of Truth or Spellcasting.

**Arm**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the nonaton can't use this arm against other targets. The nonaton has nine arms, each of which can grapple one target.

**Pillar of Truth**. The nonaton chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 60 feet of itself. A 60-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius cylinder of magical force rises from that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 21 (6d6) force damage, and the creature reverts to its original form (if it's in a different form) and can't assume a different form until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
