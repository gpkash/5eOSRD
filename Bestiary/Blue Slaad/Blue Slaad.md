**Magic Resistance**. The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration**. The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease called chaos phage. While infected, the target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a [[red slaad]] or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a [[green slaad]]. Only a [[wish]] spell can reverse the transformation.
