### Bozak Draconian
_Medium monstrosity (sorcerer), lawful evil_

![[Bozak Draconian.jpg]]

Bozak draconians are born from bronze dragon eggs and wield magic to aid their allies in battle. Their wings aren't strong enough for full flight, but bozaks can use them to glide during a fall. When bozaks die, their flesh shrivels away before their bones explode, sending a shower of magical splinters in all directions.


**Draconians** Draconians are bipedal monsters born from metallic dragon eggs that have been corrupted by a combination of warped alchemy and the Dragon Queen's foul magic. The Dragon Armies closely guard the secret of the draconians' creation, allowing Krynn's metallic dragons to continue to think their eggs are being held hostage so they don't oppose the Dragon Queen's conquests.
