**Incorporeal Movement**. The reaper can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet traveled.

**Haunting Tracker**. You and the reaper can sense the direction and distance to the haunted creature if it's on the same plane of existence as you.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The reaper makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down).

**Reaping Scythe**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ your spell attack modifier to hit (with advantage), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d10 + 3 + the spell's level necrotic damage.

**Paralyzing Fear (1/Day)**. The reaper attempts to instill fear into the haunted creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be [[frightened]] of the reaper for 1 minute. While [[frightened]] this way, the creature's speed is 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. The [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, or immediately after it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success.
