### Oshundo the Alhoon
_Medium undead (mind flayer, wizard), neutral evil_

![[Oshundo the Alhoon.jpg]]

Oshundo lived in Illithinoch at the height of the mind flayer empire many centuries ago, but Oshundo was driven out for practicing arcane magic. It's obvious that this rejection still stings Oshundo, who refers to Illithinoch's longdead leaders as "ignorant fools" who are "closed to the flexibility and power of arcane magic."

**Magic Resistance**. Oshundo has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spellcasting.** Oshundo casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Oshundo makes two Chilling Grasp or Arcane Bolt attacks.

**Chilling Grasp**. _Melee Spell Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) cold damage, and Oshundo regains 14 hit points if the target is a creature.

**Arcane Bolt**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (8d6) force damage.

**Thundering Blast Recharge 5-6**. Oshundo emits a wave of domineering energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (4d8 + 4) thunder damage and have the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute. A [[stunned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Reactions
**Negate Spell (3/Day)**. Oshundo targets one creature it can perceive within 60 feet of itself that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, the spell fails, but any spell slots or charges aren't wasted.
