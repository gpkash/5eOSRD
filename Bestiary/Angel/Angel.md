### Angel
_Medium celestial, lawful good_

![[Angel.webp]]

Angels are mysterious, detached beings seldom glimpsed by mortal eyes. They are the living incarnations of white mana, and embody its inherent tendencies toward order and harmony. Some inventors view angels in the context of the Aether Cycle as an expression of a Great Design. Given divine inspiration and an utterly perfect stage of innovation, an angel is the constructed resultâ€”a living invention. Their masks, headdresses, and armor give them an almost mechanical appearance, but they are living beings with brightly colored skin almost entirely concealed beneath their armor and decorative robes. Because of their perfection, angels are believed to be immune to the final stages of the Aether Cycle, which would involve their destruction.

The people of Kaladesh do not worship angels or beseech their intervention in mortal affairs, and such prayers would go unheard anyway. The solitary angels interact with each other only in formal, nuanced rituals whose meanings are obscure. But the sight of an angel is thought to be a good omen, and in particular, it is believed to presage success with invention.

Use the statistics of a [[deva]] for an angel on Kaladesh. Some angels (such as the one shown on the [Angel of Invention card](https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=547813]]) wield four swords with their four arms. When such an angel uses the Multiattack action, it makes four attacks rather than two. However, its weapons deal only an extra 1d10 radiant damage from its Angelic Weapons trait, so that each sword attack deals 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 5 (1d10) radiant damage on a hit.

**Angelic Weapons**. The deva's weapon attacks are magical. When the deva hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).

**Magic Resistance**. The deva has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The deva's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). The deva can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The deva makes two melee attacks.

**Mace**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage.

**Healing Touch (3/Day)**. The deva touches another creature. The target magically regains 20 ([[4d8 + 2) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

**Change Shape**. The deva magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the deva's choice). In a new form, the deva retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.
