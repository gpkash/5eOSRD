Xzar was a talented necromancer known for his erratic and bizarre behavior. He worked with the Zhentarim for a number of years with a halfling partner named Montaron or "Monty," as Xzar called him. The two of them got involved in the Bhaalspawn incident more than a century ago and their partnership dissolved soon after.

Xzar decided to attempt a magical ritual that would turn him into a lich. While successful at achieving this goal, once he embraced undeath he quickly descended into insanity. Xzar lost track of his phylactery and thus didn't feed it the souls required to fuel his undead state. Several decades later his body had crumbled to dust and Xzar had devolved into a demilich.

Before becoming a lich, Xzar had created a clone as a contingency against death. A clone usually remains inert until a soul reanimates the body. But the Slaad Lord Ssendam was able to animate the clone body by using the power of the Chaos Phage. The animated clone has the base personality of Xzar, along with his magical skills with necromancy.

This reanimated Xzar is missing a soul and because of this he does not feel whole. This has made him even more erratic than the original Xzar. Xzar is desperate to create a new soul for himself and everything he does is in pursuit of that goal. He does revere his Slaad creator, but mostly because Ssendam has promised to aid him in his quest to create a soul.

Xzar is pragmatic and manipulative enough to appear amicable while sizing up potential allies (or victims). Many of Xzar's casual observations come out as gibberish, though they can often have cryptic meanings.
