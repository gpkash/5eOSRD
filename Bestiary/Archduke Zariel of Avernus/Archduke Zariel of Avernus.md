### Archduke Zariel of Avernus
_Large fiend (devil), lawful evil_

![[Archduke Zariel of Avernus.jpg]]

Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, Zariel succumbed to the corrupting influence of the Nine Hells and fell from grace. Asmodeus admired Zariel's passion for war and offered her rulership of Avernus. She accepted his offer and was transformed by Asmodeus into an archdevil.

Zariel's "rise" came at the expense of Bel, her pit fiend predecessor. Zariel and Bel hate each other. To keep Bel busy and out of her sight, Zariel tasks him with forging weapons, armor, and gruesome demon-slaying machines.

To replenish her legions, Zariel needs the souls of mortals to create lemures, which she can then promote to higher forms of devils. Only by tempting mortals with power on the Material Plane and striking bargains with them can she bind them to her in the afterlife.

**Matalotok** Zariel recently defeated the demon lord Kostchtchie and took his hammer, Matalotok, which grants Zariel immunity to cold damage. Without this hammer, Zariel has resistance to cold damage instead.

**Devil's Sight**. Magical darkness doesn't impede Zariel's darkvision.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Zariel fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. Zariel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration**. Zariel regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn. If she takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn. Zariel dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Spellcasting.** Zariel casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 26):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Zariel makes three Flail or Longsword attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Horrid Touch, if available.

**Flail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) force damage plus 36 (8d8) fire damage.

**Longsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) radiant damage or 19 (2d10 + 8) radiant damage when used with two hands, plus 36 (8d8) fire damage.

**Horrid Touch Recharge 5-6**. Zariel touches one creature within 10 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Constitution saving throw or take 44 (8d10) necrotic damage and have the [[poisoned]] condition for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the target has the [[blinded]] and [[deafened]] conditions. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Teleport**. Zariel magically teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.

##### Legendary Actions
