### Trilobite
_Tiny beast, unaligned_

![[Trilobite.jpg]]

On the beaches and banks of the rivers and seas, crabs scuttle across the sand and birds wade in the shallow water. Trilobites are among the most common shore-dwellers, including predatory varieties as well as scavengers and filter-feeders consuming scraps they find in the sand.
