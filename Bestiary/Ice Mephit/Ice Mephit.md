**Death Burst**. When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of jagged ice. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**False Appearance**. While the mephit remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary shard of ice.

**Innate Spellcasting (1/Day).** The mephit can innately cast [[fog cloud]], requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.
