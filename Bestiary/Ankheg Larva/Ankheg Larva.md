### Ankheg Larva
*Medium monstrosity, unaligned*

![[Ankheg Larva.jpg]]

Larval ankhegs might not seem as threatening as their [[Ankheg| mature counterparts]] at first, but the innate acid production of these monstrosities are never to be underestimated.

Ankheg larvae do not have much control over the use of their acid in these early stages of their life, but their comparatively weak bodies are filled to the brim with this dangerous substance.

Arguably the worst part of hunting these creatures, is that they tend to explode just before their death in a final bid to eliminate their attacker. It is suspected that this ability of the ankheg larva was naturally developed so they would not be considered viable food sources for other predators, or to stop the attacker from continuing an assault on any of their kin.

**Killing Method** The best method to go about hunting ankheg larvae is to attack the larvae from a distance whilst any larger, mature ankheg are distracted elsewhere. Due to the slow speed at which the larvae travel, it is not difficult to keep a good distance between you and them. However, do not keep too far out of reach, or else they might burrow away from you in an attempt to escape.

**Material Uses** If they are killed utilizing fire or some type of lightning (such as through magic means), the ankheg larva's explosion will be fully suppressed, as it prevents the appropriate internal reaction from taking place. This is the only known way to obtain a mostly intact carcass of one.

It should however be noted that the only particularly valuable part of them is their acid. This can be gathered even if they do explode on death, but extracting the acid from an intact carcass is not only much easier, but much more efficient.

Their mandibles and chitin are too underdeveloped to be of much practical use at all.

**Terminal Splat**. When the ankeg larva is reduced to 0 hit points by an attack that does not deal fire or lightning damage, it explodes in a burst of acid. Each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) acid damage on a fail, or half as much on a success.

##### Actions

**Bite**. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) acid damage.

**Larval Eructing** (Recharge 4-6). The ankheg larva messily spits acid in a cone that is 10 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that cone must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
