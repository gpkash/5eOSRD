**Awakening of the Scion**. The cradle is a container for the [[scion of Surtur|BGG]]. When the cradle drops to 0 hit points, its body hardens and crumbles to ash. The scion instantly appears in the space the cradle occupied and uses the cradle's initiative count.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day)**. If the cradle fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. The cradle has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster**. The cradle deals double damage to objects and structures.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The cradle makes three Slam or Hurl Lava attacks in any combination.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (4d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.

**Hurl Lava**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (4d8 + 9) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature within 5 feet of the fire takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 10 (3d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Erupting Breath Recharge 5-6**. The cradle exhales flames and volcanic gases in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) fire damage and has the [[poisoned]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature [[poisoned]] in this way can make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
