**Devil's Sight**. Magical darkness doesn't impede Adramalech's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance**. Adramalech has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Unbreakable Bond**. If Adramalech is reduced to 0 hit points while Brother Morax still lives, Adramalech regenerates 50 hit points at the start of his next turn. This regeneration is interrupted if Brother Morax is reduced to 0 hit points before the start of Adramalech's turn.

##### Actions

**Barrage**. He can replace one of the attacks with Brain Freeze or Cone of Madness (if available).

**Mental Barrage**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60/120 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (4d8 + 7) psychic damage.

**Brain Freeze**. Adramalech attempts to overload the brain of a creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must make a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Creatures that fail the saving throw have the [[stunned]] condition for up to 1 minute. A [[stunned]] creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Cone of Madness Recharge 4-6**. Adramalech unleashes visions in a 30-foot cone in front of him. All creatures in the cone must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. For up to 1 minute, creatures that failed the save can't take reactions and each turn must use their action to make a melee attack against the nearest creature. Creatures may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

##### Legendary Actions
**Barrage**. Adramalech makes a Mental Barrage attack.

**Mental Blocker**. Adramalech fortifies the mind of a creature he can see within 60 feet of him, or himself. The target benefits as if the [[Greater Restoration]] spell has been cast on them and is granted resistance to psychic damage until the end of Adramalech's next turn.
