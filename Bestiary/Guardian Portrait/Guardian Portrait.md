### Guardian Portrait
_Medium construct, unaligned_

![[Guardian Portrait.jpg]]

A guardian portrait looks like a finely rendered and beautifully framed work of art, usually depicting someone important in a realistic manner. The picture and its frame are bound with powerful magic and are inseparable.

**Living Image** The eyes of the figure depicted in the painting are imbued with [[ darkvision]], and they appear to follow creatures that move in front of them.


**Innate Spells** When a guardian portrait attacks, the figure in the painting animates and moves as though alive (albeit in two dimensions). The guardian portrait has no effective melee attacks, but it has a repertoire of innate spells that it can cast. When it casts a spell, the figure painted on the canvas makes all the appropriate somatic gestures and verbal incantations for the spell.

**Constructed Nature**. An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

**Antimagic Susceptibility**. The portrait is [[incapacitated]] while in the area of an [[antimagic field]]. If targeted by [[dispel magic]], the portrait must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or become [[unconscious]] for 1 minute.

**False Appearance**. While the figure in the portrait remains motionless, the portrait is indistinguishable from a normal painting.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The portrait's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12). The portrait can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
