### Canopic Golem
_Large construct, _

![[Canopic Golem.jpg]]

A mummy lord's organs, normally stored in sacred canopic jars during mummification, can be magically preserved and transplanted into living humanoids. The transplant recipients come under the control of the mummy lord, either as living supplicants or mindless golems through which the mummy lord can see and speak.

**Limited Spell Immunity**. The golem automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells of 7th level or lower, and the attack rolls of such spells always miss it.

**Unusual Nature**. The golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The golem makes two attacks.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (4d10 + 5) force damage.

**Crystal Dart**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) force damage.

#### Reactions
**Spell Deflection**. In response to a spell attack missing the golem, it causes that spell to hit another creature within 120 feet of it that it can see.
