**Spellcasting.** The sage casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks):

##### Actions
**Shocking Grasp (Cantrip)**. _Melee Spell Attack:_ +6 to hit (with advantage if the target is wearing armor made of metal), reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d8) lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

#### Reactions
**Shield (1st-Level Spell; 3/Day)**. When the sage is hit by an attack or targeted by a [[magic missile]] spell, it calls forth an [[invisible]] barrier of magical force that protects it. Until the start of its next turn, the sage has a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and it takes no damage from magic missile.
