**Sneak Attack (1/Turn)**. The cutthroat deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the cutthroat that isn't [[incapacitated]] and the cutthroat doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The cutthroat makes two shortsword or dagger attacks.

**Shortsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

**Dagger**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

#### Reactions
**Uncanny Dodge**. The cutthroat halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The cutthroat must be able to see the attacker.
