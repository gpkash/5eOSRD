**Evasion**. If the skydancer is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throws to take only half damage, the skydancer instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throws, and only half damage if it fails.

**Flyby**. The skydancer doesn't provoke an [[ opportunity attack]] when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Skysail**. The skydancer flies with a special Ashari magic item called a [[Skysail]]. While the [[Skysail|skysail's]] wings are extended, the skydancer can glide through the air at a speed of 60 feet, but must descend by at least 10 feet at the end of its turn and can't gain altitude.

**Spellcasting.** The skydancer is a 3rd-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following druid spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): [[guidance]], [[shillelagh]]
1st level (4 slots): [[entangle]], [[fog cloud]], [[jump]]
2nd level (2 slots): [[gust of wind]], [[pass without trace]]

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The skydancer makes two [[Skysail]] staff attacks.

**Skysail Staff**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the skydancer makes this attack while flying, the target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throws, taking 21 (6d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Fly (1/Day)**. The skydancer uses its [[Skysail]] to cast [[fly]] on itself for up to 1 minute (no [[concentration]] required).

#### Reactions
**Slow Fall**. When the skydancer takes [[falling]] damage, it can reduce the damage by half.
