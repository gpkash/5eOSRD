**Assassinate**. During his first turn, the Champion has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the Champion scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

**Aura of Protection**. While the Champion is conscious, he and friendly creatures within 10 feet of him have a +3 bonus to saving throws (included above).

**Eternal Champion**. When the Champion is reduced to 0 hit points or dies, his body is destroyed but his spirit returns to the [[ The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|Raven Queen's]] side, and he gains a new body after 1d4 days.

**Evasion**. If the Champion is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throws to take only half damage, he instead takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throws, and only half damage if he fails.

**Fate-Touched (4/Day)**. When the Champion makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throws, he can reroll the d20 and use either roll. Alternatively, when a creature the Champion can see makes an attack roll against him, or a saving throws against one of his spells or features, he can force that creature to reroll the attack or save and use the new roll.

**Shadow Smite (1/Turn)**. The Champion deals an extra 49 (14d6) radiant or necrotic damage (his choice) when he hits a target with a weapon attack and he doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Unerring Sight**. The Champion's ranged weapon attacks ignore [[half cover]] and [[three-quarters cover]] and have no range penalty.

**Special Equipment**. The Champion wears [[Boots of Haste]] and the [[Deathwalker's Ward (Exalted)|Deathwalker's Ward]], and wields [[Whisper (Exalted)|Whisper]].

**Innate Spellcasting.** The Champion's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (+10 to hit with spell attacks, save DC 18). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The Champion makes three attacks with [[Whisper (Exalted)|Whisper]].

**Whisper**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d4 + 8) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) psychic damage. On a critical hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throws or be [[frightened]] of the Champion for 1 minute. On a ranged attack, the Champion can teleport with [[Whisper (Exalted)|Whisper]], appearing within 5 feet of the target on a hit, or in a random space within 30 feet of the target on a miss.

**Touch of Life and Death (Recharges after a [[Short Rest]] or [[Long Rest]])**. The Champion touches a creature within 5 feet of him, and chooses to either heal or harm that creature, restoring 55 (10d10) hit points or dealing 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. If the creature is an unwilling target, it can avoid either effect with a successful DC 20 Dexterity saving throws.

#### Reactions
**Uncanny Dodge**. The Champion halves the damage that he takes from an attack that hits him. He must be able to see the attacker.
