### Winged Lion
_Large celestial, unaligned_

![[Winged Lion token.png]]

Archons always ride into battle on fearsome winged mounts. Some legends suggest that the mount is actually a physical manifestation of the archon's will, allowing the pair to act with a single mind. The two most common archon mounts are winged bulls and winged lions.
