### The Hungry
_Medium monstrosity, lawful evil_

![[The Hungry.webp]]

**The Hungry** Horrid beasts with grasping claws and yawning mouths, the Hungry do whatever is necessary to sate their appetites. These greedy devourers consume all life and energy they encounter, stuffing their maws with flesh and drinking in their victims' screams. When they finish, they lurch away while their bright eyes resume the search for something else to consume.

**Sorrowsworn** The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. The sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering that are inherent to the shadowy landscape, and they visit horror on those who stumble into their midst.

**Emotion Given Form** Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress. Some are manifestations of anger; others are loneliness given physical form. Their nature provides a clue both to understanding how they become more powerful and to overcoming them. Giving in to the negative emotions that the sorrowsworn represent causes these entities to grow deadlier. Fighting against these emotions can weaken them and drive them away.

##### Lore

History DC 15: Creatures do not die of deprivation in the plane of shadow, but their appetites are not abated, and the depths of hunger endured by its residents who lack ready access to food are matched nowhere in the great wheel.

Some such denizens are themselves consumed by this hunger, and then are driven to consume all others, though their appetite can never be even momentarily sated

Nature DC 15: The ravenous frenzy of the hungry is further provoked whenever a creature it can see is magically healed, though such interventions are often required regardless, as the hungry will happily swallow whole a wounded creature, even one larger than it.

##### Tactics

One often comes upon the hungry mid-gorging, though they will always break off to pursue fresh prey. The hungry attacks the creature with the most unexpended hit die, attacking with its claws and then attempting to swallow it whole once it drops. If the creature has no unexpended hit dice, the hungry does not make a second attempt, instead going after whichever creature now has the greatest number of unexpended hit dice.

**Life Hunger**. If a creature the Hungry can see regains hit points, the Hungry gains two benefits until the end of its next turn: it has advantage on attack rolls, and its bite deals an extra 22 (4d10) necrotic damage on a hit.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The Hungry makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) necrotic damage.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16) and is [[restrained]] until the grapple ends. While grappling a creature, the Hungry can't attack with its claws.
