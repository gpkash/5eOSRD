### Awakened Zurkhwood
_Huge plant, unaligned_

![[Awakened Zurkhwood token.png]]

This creature is an ordinary zurkhwood mushroom (see "Fungi of the Underdark" in chapter 2) given sentience and mobility. An awakened zurkhwood can be created by casting the [[awaken]] spell on a normal zurkhwood mushroom. A myconid sovereign can create one by performing a lengthy ritual.

An awakened zurkhwood has the same statistics as an awakened tree (see appendix A of the Monster Manual), with the following modifications:

**Armor Class** 13 (natural armor)
**Hit Points** 59 (7d12 + 14)
**Speed** 20 ft.

**False Appearance**. While the tree remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal zurkhwood mushroom.

**Mute**. If the awakened zurkhwood was created by a myconid sovereign, it can't speak.

##### Actions
**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
