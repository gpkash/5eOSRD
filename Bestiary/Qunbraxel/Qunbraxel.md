### Qunbraxel
_Medium aberration (mind flayer, warlock), lawful evil_

![[Qunbraxel.webp]]

Qunbraxel is an arrogant mind flayer warlock. Qunbraxel is always attended by four loyal grimlocks. They swap this duty with other grimlocks nearby, although Qunbraxel can hardly be bothered to tell one grimlock minion from another.

Cut off from any elder brain Qunbraxel considers worthy, the mind flayer hopes to join the Ilvaash fanatics and receive power and insight from the Far Realm.

**Magic Resistance**. Qunbraxel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spellcasting (Psionics).** Qunbraxel casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Qunbraxel makes two Eldritch Bolt attacks, or one Eldritch Bolt attack and one Tentacle attack.

**Tentacle**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16) and must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the grapple ends.

**Eldritch Bolt**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) force damage.

**Extract Brain**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Humanoid with the [[stunned]] condition who is [[grappled]] by Qunbraxel. Hit: 55 (10d10) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, Qunbraxel kills it by extracting and devouring its brain.

**Mind Blast Recharge 5-6**. Qunbraxel magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 26 (5d8 + 4) psychic damage and have the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute. A [[stunned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
