##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Jade Tigress makes three attacks.

**Force Strike**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of Jade Tigress's next turn.

**Poisoned Dart**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 7 (3d4) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]].

**Heal Self (Recharges after a Long Rest)**. Jade Tigress regains [[2d8 + 2 hit points, and all levels of [[exhaustion]] end on her.

#### Reactions
**Deflect Missile**. In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, Jade Tigress deflects the missile. The damage she takes from the attack is reduced by [[1d10 + 9. If the damage is reduced to 0, Jade Tigress catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and Jade Tigress has a hand free.
