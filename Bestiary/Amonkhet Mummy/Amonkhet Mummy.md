### Amonkhet Mummy
_Medium undead, lawful evil_

![[Amonkhet Mummy Lord.webp]]

Not every citizen of Naktamun proves to be worthy of the afterlife. Acolytes sometimes die before the Ceremony of Measurement, perhaps in training accidents. Many initiates perish in one of the first four trials, before earning their five cartouches. Viziers sometimes die before they have truly earned a place in the afterlife serving their gods. Without having proven themselves worthy, these poor souls have no place as Eternals in the afterlifeâ€”but neither have they committed a grievous sin that would warrant abandoning them to the Curse of Wandering as marauding [[amonkhet mummy|amonkhet mummies]].

Fortunately, the beneficence of the God-Pharaoh is great enough to provide a role for these people. Called the anointed, they are carefully embalmed, protected from the Curse of Wandering, and allowed to spend another lifetime in service to the worthy. The God-Pharaoh promises that those who faithfully serve as the anointed will earn a place as attendants in the afterlife as well, and even an eternity of service in the afterlife is preferable to an eternity subjected to the Curse of Wandering.

The bodies of the anointed are carefully wrapped in cloth and adorned with cartouches. In contrast to the cartouches of initiates and viziers, these do not harbor the life essence of the deceased at their best. Instead, they coach the anointed for a particular form of service. With their cartouches in place, the anointed rise and join the ranks of serving [[amonkhet mummy]] who attend to the needs of daily life in Amonkhet.

**The Curse of Wandering** The Curse of Wandering is the greatest danger of the desert lands. A creature killed in the desert rises again as a [[zombie]] as soon as the moisture has dried from its flesh. As a result, the corpses of every kind of desert creature shamble across the dunes alongside the humanoid [[zombie||zombies]] of dissenter and would-be explorers. Most of these former humanoids are mindless marauders, though some tales speak of [[amonkhet mummy]] that have retained a sinister intelligence and even magical ability, becoming [[amonkhet mummy lord|mummy lords]].

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack with its rotting fist.

**Rotting Fist**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the [[remove curse]] spell or other magic.

**Dreadful Glare**. The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become [[frightened]] until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also [[paralyzed]] for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.
