![[Silverquill Professor of Radiance token.png]]

Professors of radiance call up magic through spoken words and glyphs formed of magically shaped ink and light. The professors channel radiance to illuminate their allies, bolstering them with encouragement and inspiring any who witness their orations. Professors of radiance can turn their words into potent assets in battle or strike at their foes with searing radiance.

These Silverquill teachers seek to inspire greatness in all that they do, pushing their students to look for the good in all things and bring that into the light.


**Silverquill Scholars** The scholars of Silverquill College study the power of magic shaped through spoken and written words. They use that power either to illuminate and guide or to obscure and demoralize.
