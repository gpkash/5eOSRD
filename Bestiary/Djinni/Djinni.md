**Elemental Demise**. If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice).

**Create Whirlwind**. A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains [[concentration]] (as if [[concentration||concentrating]] on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be [[restrained]] by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures [[restrained]] by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it. A creature can use its action to free a creature [[restrained]] by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer [[restrained]] and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
