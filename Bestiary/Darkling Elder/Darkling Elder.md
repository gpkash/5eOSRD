**Death Burn**. When the darkling elder dies, magical light flashes out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 7 (2d6) radiant damage and, if the creature can see the light, is [[blinded]] until the end of its next turn. If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes half the damage and isn't [[blinded]].

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The darkling elder makes two melee attacks.

**Shortsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the darkling elder had advantage on the attack roll, the attack deals as: extra 10 (3d6) piercing damage.

**Darkness (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. The darkling elder casts [[darkness]] without any components. Wisdom is its spellcasting ability.
