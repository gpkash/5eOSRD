### Giant Ice Toad
_Large monstrosity, neutral_

![[Giant Ice Toad token.png]]

In a cavern within the glacial rift (Against the Giants), a group of ice toads vigorously guard their territory. Waves of cold radiate from the creature, afflicting those that try to approach it, and anyone unfortunate enough to be swallowed suffers injury from cold as well as from the toad's digestive juices.
