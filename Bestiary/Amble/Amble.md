**Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow**. At the start of a short or long rest, Amble can touch a point in space, and an [[invisible]], 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. Total cover blocks the sphere. While within the sphere, Amble and their allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere isn't visible outside it. The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when Amble leaves the sphere.

**Hold Breath**. Amble can hold their breath for up to 1 hour at a time.

**Balm of the Summer Court (12d6)**. (As a Bonus Action) Amble can choose one creature they can see within 120 feet of them and spend up to 6d6 of their die pool. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent. Amble regains all expended dice when they finish a long rest.

**Hidden Paths (4/Day)**. (As a Bonus Action) Amble may teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space they can see.

**Spellcasting.** Amble is a 12th-level spellcaster. Their spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). Amble has the following druid spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): [[guidance]], [[mending]], [[shape water]], [[shillelagh]]
1st level (4 slots): [[absorb elements]], [[cure wounds]], [[entangle]], [[speak with animals]]
2nd level (3 slots): [[darkvision]], [[hold person]], [[lesser restoration]], [[moonbeam]]
3rd level (3 slots): [[conjure animals]], [[dispel magic]], [[water breathing]]
4th level (3 slots): [[charm monster]], [[freedom of movement]]
5th level (2 slots): [[greater restoration]], [[mass cure wounds]]
6th level (1 slots): [[conjure fey]]

##### Actions
**Change Shape (2/Day)**. Amble magically polymorphs into a beast with a challenge rating of 1 or less, and can remain in this form for up to 6 hours. Amble's equipment melds with their new form. Amble reverts to their true form if they die or fall [[unconscious]]. Amble can revert to their true form using a bonus action on their turn. Amble's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but they retain their alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Amble also retains all their skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as Amble and the bonus in its stat block is higher, use the creature's bonus instead of Amble's. When Amble transforms, they assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When Amble reverts to their normal form, they return to the number of hit points they had before they transformed. However, if Amble reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over their normal form. Amble can't cast spells, and their ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of their beast form. Transforming doesn't break Amble's [[concentration]] on a spell they've already cast however, or prevent them from taking actions that are part of a spell.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.

**Club**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit (+8 to hit with shillelagh), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage with shillelagh.
