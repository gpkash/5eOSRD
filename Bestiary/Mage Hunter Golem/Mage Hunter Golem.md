**Antimagic Cone**. The golem creates an area of antimagic, as in the [[antimagic field]] spell, in a 60-foot cone originating from it. At the start of each of its turns, the golem decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active.

**Immutable Form**. The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Absorption**. Whenever the golem is subjected to a damage-dealing spell of 4th level or lower, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt.

**Magic Resistance**. The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. The golem's weapon attacks are magical.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The golem uses its Antimagic Jolt and makes two melee attacks, or it makes three melee attacks.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Claw Recharge 5-6**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throws or have a magic collar placed upon its neck. While the target wears the collar, it is magically prevented from speaking and cannot cast any spell. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using [[Thieves' Tools]] removes the collar.

**Antimagic Jolt**. Each creature within the golem's Antimagic Cone that has the ability to cast a spell of 1st level or higher must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throws, taking 21 (6d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
