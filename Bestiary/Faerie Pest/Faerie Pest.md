**Spellcasting.** The faerie casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

##### Actions
**Stingblade**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage. If the faerie had advantage on the attack roll, the target takes an additional 3 (1d6) slashing damage.

**Theft of Nerves (1/Day)**. The faerie unleashes a burst of mind-muddling magic in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or have the [[frightened]] condition for 1 minute. A [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
