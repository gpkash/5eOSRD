**Adhesive Slime**. The farastu secretes a thick, tarlike slime and it can choose to use this slime to secure enemies that it has [[grappled]] or to make weapons become attached to it. It is able to end the adhesion with a bonus action, causing all items and creatures secured to it to be released. The adhesion also ends after the farastu dies.

**Devil's Sight**. Magical darkness doesn't impede the farastu's darkvision.

**Keen Smell**. The farastu has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Magic Resistance**. The farastu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. The farastu's weapon attacks are magical.

**Reckless**. At the start of its turn, the farastu can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The farastu makes two claw or bite attacks.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is held fast by the farastu's adhesive slime ([[grappled]], escape DC 15) if the farastu isn't already grappling a creature.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

#### Reactions
**Adhesive Hide**. After taking damage from a melee weapon, the farastu can use its reaction to take the weapon, if the attacker fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The weapon is attached to the farastu's hide until it releases the weapon, or an attacker takes an action and succeeds with a DC 15 Strength check to pry it off the farastu.
