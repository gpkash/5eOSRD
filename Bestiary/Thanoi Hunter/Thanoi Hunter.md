### Thanoi Hunter
_Medium monstrosity, any alignment_

![[Thanoi Hunter.webp]]

Thanoi are walrus-like beings who dwell in the frozen wastelands of Krynn. They sport thick, ivory tusks, which they use both to defend themselves and to poke breathing holes in sea ice as they swim.

Often at odds with the monstrous creatures that live in the frozen wastes, thanoi are adept hunters. In addition to their tusks, they use harpoons on long ropes that they can quickly reel back. Groups of thanoi hunters work together to take down monsters far larger than themselves, including remorhazes and white dragons.
