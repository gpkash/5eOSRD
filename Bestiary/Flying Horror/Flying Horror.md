### Flying Horror
_Medium aberration, neutral evil_

![[Flying Horror.jpg]]

**Horrors and Madness** Horrors on Ravnica are terror and madness personified. You can represent this reality by using the madness rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

Whenever a character fails a saving throw against the flying horror's Frightening Screech, the shadow horror's claw attack, or the skittering horror's Maddening Presence, note that fact. At the end of the encounter, have each character who failed at least one of those saving throws make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, nothing happens. On a failed save, a character gains a form of madness from the Dungeon Master's Guide, with the severity depending on how many of the saving throws that character failed during the encounter, as shown on the Madness Severity table.





**Horrors** Terrifying evils stalk, fly, and scuttle in the dark corners of Ravnica, from the depths of the undercity to the blackest parts of the night sky. Collectively, these creatures are called horrors-a variety of things that lurk in the dark and embody the deepest fears of Ravnica's people. All are evil creatures with dim reason and preternatural cunning.

At least three guilds have been known to compel horrors into service. For House Dimir, horrors spread fear and despair in the citizenry and carry out assassinations or kidnappings against well-protected targets. For the Cult of Rakdos, horrors are simply one more weapon in an arsenal of terrifying and shock-inspiring creatures that might appear on stage. For the Golgari Swarm, horrors scavenge the sewers and protect the guild's territory.

House Dimir uses all three base kinds of horrors. The Cult of Rakdos prefers shadow horrors, and the Golgari Swarm uses skittering horrors.


**Customizing a Horror** Horrors share some common body types but vary wildly in other characteristics. A particular horror's form might incorporate elements that resemble fiendish, insectile, or reptilian features. To customize a horror, choose a base creature (flying horror, shadow horror, or skittering horror), then roll once on the Primary Features table and once on the Secondary Features table (or choose an option from each table). Add those features to the base creature.

**Fear Frenzy**. The horror has advantage on attack rolls against [[frightened]] creatures.

**Sunlight Sensitivity**. While in sunlight, the horror has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

##### Actions
**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) psychic damage.

**Frightening Screech Recharge 5-6**. The horror screeches. Each creature within 30 feet of it that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of it for 1 minute. The [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the horror's Frightening Screech for the next 24 hours.
