### Vampirate Captain
_Medium undead, lawful evil_

![[Vampirate Captain token.png]]

How a crew of vampirates conducts itself depends entirely on the mood and disposition of the captain. The crew of one ship might behave like a murderous mob, while another might abide by an ancient code of chivalry. One captain might allow the crew of a plundered ship to live, while another might leave only flotsam and jetsam in the pirates' wake.

The captain is often accompanied by an undying companion, such as a crawling claw or a will-o'-wisp.

**Explode**. When the captain is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes in a cloud of ash. Any creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3d10) necrotic damage.

**Spider Climb**. The captain can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Unusual Nature**. The captain doesn't require air or drink.

##### Actions
**Energy Drain**. _Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one creature. Hit: 22 (4d10) necrotic damage. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies and instantly transforms into a free-willed shadow or vampirate (captain's choice) under the DM's control.

**Heavy Crossbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d10 + 3) piercing damage.

**Ship Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. A ship upon which the captain stands, along with all creatures and objects aboard it, becomes [[invisible]] to creatures not aboard the ship. The captain must concentrate on this magical effect to maintain it (as if [[concentration||concentrating]] on a spell), and it lasts for up to 1 hour. The effect ends if the captain leaves the ship.

#### Reactions
**Uncanny Dodge**. The captain halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The captain must be able to see the attacker.
