![[Monastic Infiltrator token.png]]

Infiltrators act as spies, saboteurs, and perpetrators of other clandestine activities. They study magical techniques that enhance their prowess in battle and help them complete their assignments.


**Monastics of the Cobalt Soul** Scholars, priests, and ascetics who have been drawn to the cause of truth and knowledge spend their lives in support of the Library of the Cobalt Soul, united by the teachings of Ioun the Knowing Mentor. The Cobalt Soul is guided by a central belief that true strength comes from understanding the world around you. Beyond its efforts in knowledge-seeking, each branch of the Cobalt Soul strives to expose lies, unveil propaganda, and fight corruption in whatever society their chapter, referred to as an archive, calls home.

The Library of the Cobalt Soul is headquartered in Rexxentrum, the capital of the Dwendalian Empire on the continent of Wildemount. The organization has archives across Exandria. The Ank'Hareli branch of the Cobalt Soul is based in the Temple of the Mentor. Like many of the archives, the Temple of the Mentor is both a vast library and a shrine to Ioun. This Marquesian archive is led by High Curator Jamil A'alithiya.
