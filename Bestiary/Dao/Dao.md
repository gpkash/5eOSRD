**Earth Glide**. The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dao doesn't disturb the material it moves through.

**Elemental Demise**. If the dao dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying.

**Sure-Footed**. The dao has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it [[prone]].

**Innate Spellcasting.** The dao's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The Dao makes two fist attacks or two maul attacks.

**Fist**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Maul**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked [[prone]].
