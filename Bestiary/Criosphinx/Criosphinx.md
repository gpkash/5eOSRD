### Criosphinx
_Large monstrosity, neutral_

![[Criosphinx.webp]]

A rare few [[amonkhet sphinx|PSA|sphinxes]] have the heads of rams instead of the humanlike faces of other [[amonkhet sphinx|PSA|sphinxes]]. Though they lie under the same curse as all their kind, they are less enigmatic and more aggressive, actively attacking [[angel of amonkhet|PSA|angels]], demons, and other agents of Bolas they encounter in the desert. They stay far from Naktamun and care little for its people. Their hatred of Bolas is driven only by his curse.

**Sphinxes** [[amonkhet sphinx|PSA|Sphinxes]] are inscrutable beings, and keepers of secrets and mysteries. They have leonine bodies, hawklike wings, and faces resembling humans, framed by great frills or manes of feathers. Their powerful forearms are also feathered, and fans of long feathers form their tails.

The [[amonkhet sphinx|PSA|sphinxes]] of Amonkhet are perhaps the only creatures to remain uncorrupted by the influence of Nicol Bolas on this plane. Their impenetrable minds proved to be beyond even Bolas's ability to control—but even so, he was able to place them under a curse to guarantee their silence. A [[amonkhet sphinx|PSA|sphinx]] is utterly incapable of communication—verbal or nonverbal, even written—as long as the curse remains in effect. In this way, Bolas has prevented the [[amonkhet sphinx|PSA|sphinxes]] from revealing his system of lies to the people or gods of Naktamun.
