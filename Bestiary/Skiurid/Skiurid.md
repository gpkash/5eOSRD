Advancement —

Shadow Jump (Su) As the dimension door spell; up to 3/day; caster level 1st.

The magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some shadow. A skiurid can jump up to 30 feet each day in this manner; this can be a single jump  
or a combination of jumps whose distance totals 30 feet. This amount can be split among several jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.

Chill Darkness (Su) As the darkness spell; 3/day; caster level 3rd.

A creature within the radius of this effect takes 1d6 points of damage and also takes 1 point of Strength damage unless it succeeds on a DC 13 Fortitude save. The creature takes no further damage as long as it remains within the area, but if it leaves and reenters, it is subject to both types of damage again. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

At the end of the effect’s duration, if any creature has taken damage within its area, the shadows coalesce into a small nodule, about the size of a peach pit, that provides nourishment for the skiurid.

This ability has no effect on undead or creatures native to the Plane of Shadow. The shadowy illumination created by this ability is sufficient for the skiurid to use its shadow jump ability.

Skills Skiurids have a +8 racial bonus on Balance, Climb, Hide, and Move Silently checks. A skiurid can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. A skiurid uses its Dexterity modifier instead of its Strength modifier for Climb checks.

A skiurid is a shadow-born version of a squirrel, disturbingly familiar in appearance but undeniably malicious.

STRATEGIES AND TACTICS

Skiurids operate in colonies, taking advantage of their natu- ral agility and stealth. A nest of them uses chill darkness to cloak as large an area as possible, thus providing food for

the entire group. Among creatures of animal intelligence, however, this cooperation is a matter of instinct, not rea- soned tactics.

Skiurids prefer not to attack with their feeble bite, using it only as a last resort when they are caught in melee. If things go poorly with a chill darkness attack, they quickly disappear into the shadows.

Skiurids are often encountered with other creatures of shadow. Their chill darkness ability reinforces the hunt- ing methods of the other creatures, which are not harmed by it.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Skiurids might be accompanied by beings from the Plane of Shadow or could be found in the groves of dark fey.

Colony (EL 5–10): Skiurids form colonies consisting of up to several dozen individuals. They are alone only under extraor- dinary circumstances (such as being caught in a trap).

EL 9: A colony of twenty skiurids inhabits a dark grove in a forest inhabited by shadar-kai (Fiend Folio 150). The shadow fey prize the coalesced shadows on which skiurids feed, and they often drive other beings toward the grove to maintain a high level of production.

Umbral Banyan Nest (EL 10–12): Skiurids often live in or near umbral banyans (Manual of the Planes 171), which offer protection and a ready supply of captives from which to drain life.

EL 12: This umbral banyan supports a colony of thirty- four skiurids. They wait until the dark tree snares a living creature, then blanket the area with their chill darkness.

SKIURID KNOWLEDGE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (the planes) can learn more about skiurids. When a character makes a successful skill check, the following lore is revealed, including the information from lower DCs.

10 Skiurids are magical beasts native to the Plane of

Shadow. This result reveals all magical beast traits

and the extraplanar subtype.  
15 Sometimes skiurids enter the Material Plane. 20 Skiurids feed on concentrated life energy, which

they drain from living creatures and store up.  
25 The concentrated life energy is valuable as a spell

component for necromancy magic.

SKIURIS

ECOLOGY

Skiurids are native to the Plane of Shadow and feed solely on life energy. Unlike shadows, which attack victims directly, skiurids blanket an area with chill dark- ness and let it drain life force from creatures that enter it. They then gather up the “nuggets”

of coalesced shadow and store them within their dens for later consumption. This propensity makes skiurids tempting prey for other shadow creatures, which covet the concentrated life energy. Shadow mastiffs and dusk beasts (Manual of the Planes 169) are their usual predators, but spellcasters also seek out the coalesced shadow for use in nec- romantic magic.

Skiurids form large colo-  
nies, allowing them to pool their  
abilities and harvest large quan-  
tities of life energy. They often  
live in or near umbral banyans. Coordinating  
their efforts helps the tree dispatch its prey  
more quickly and allows the skiurids to harvest the dying creature’s life force before it succumbs. The relationship is mutually beneficial.

A typical skiurid lives two to three years, with five years being the maximum. It is mature at six months of age, and a female can produce several litters in a year, depending on the availability of food. Adults feed their young life energy; they gnaw on a nugget of coalesced shadow to extract the nour- ishment and then allow the pups to sip from their mouths. A single nugget can sustain a litter of six to eight young for one day.

Environment: Skiurids are native to the Plane of Shadow but often end up in other planes of existence along with the creatures with which they associate.

Sometimes skiurids get left behind accidentally when an umbral banyan shifts to a haunted forest on the Material Plane. Despite the disruption, such migrants usually thrive as long as they remain in the dark heart of the forest. They are occasionally found with the bitter shadar-kai.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A skiurid is around 14 inches in length, excluding the tail. It looks something like a gaunt, outsized squirrel, but a malevolent reddish gleam shines in its eyes. Its body is a deep gray or black, and the creature blends readily into shadows.

Alignment: Skiurids are interested only in feeding and are inimical to most life forms other than those of the Plane of Shadow. Their total disregard for other beings makes them neutral evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Skiurids do not collect treasure, but their stores of life energy are prized by many beings. Necromancers in particular seek out skiurid hoards and pay well for them; a nugget of

Skiurids

coalesced shadow is worth 1,000 gp. Skiurids share their dens, so obtaining a hoard usually requires defeating large numbers of them (as well as any other creatures found in the den).

A skiurid nest typically contains one shadow nugget per four adults, representing the excess stored by the colony for lean times and for rearing young.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

A nugget of stored life energy can serve as an optional mate- rial component for necromancy spells. It has a 50% chance of increasing such a spell’s effective caster level by 2.

SKIURIDS IN EBERRON

Skiurids are usually found in Mabar manifest zones. These are most common in the Shadow Marches, but the jungles of Xen’drik might hide such deadly groves.

When Mabar is coterminous with Eberron, the dark places of the world become blacker and more dangerous. At these times, shadow beings can more easily slip between the worlds, and colonies of skiurids end up in earthly forests, especially the fey woods of the Eldeen Reaches.

SKIURIDS IN FAERÛN

Devotees of the Shadow Weave, dark fey, and creatures of shadow share a mystical connection with Shar, the deity of dark magic. Such creatures not only inhabit her home, the Plane of Shadow, but also favor areas of Faerûn where Shar’s influence is strong. The Darkhouse of Saeldoon (Faiths and Pantheons 163) is an example of a cult devoted to the Lady of Loss. Adding a colony of skiurids to its groves is a simple matter. Perhaps the cult uses skiurids to extract life energy from prisoners.
