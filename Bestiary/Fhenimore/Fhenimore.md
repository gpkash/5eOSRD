**Voice of the Kraken (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. A kraken speaks through the priest with a thunderous voice audible within 300 feet. Creatures of the priest's choice that can hear the kraken's words (which are spoken in Abyssal, Infernal, or Primordial) must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of the priest for 1 minute. A [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
