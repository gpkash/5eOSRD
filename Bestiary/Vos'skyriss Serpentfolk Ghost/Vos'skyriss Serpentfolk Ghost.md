**Ethereal Sight**. The ghost can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

**Incorporeal Movement**. The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were [[difficult terrain]]. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The ghost makes two spear attacks.

**Spear**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the ghost makes a ranged attack, its spear rematerializes in its hands after the attack is resolved.

**Etherealness**. The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

**Terrifying Hiss**. The ghost emits an uncanny, rasping hiss. Each non-undead creature within 30 feet of the ghost that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throws or be [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throws at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throws is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Terrifying Hiss for the next 24 hours.
