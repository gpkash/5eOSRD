**Aura of Radiance**. The councilor magically sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The councilor can extinguish or restore this light as a bonus action. If the bright light overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created that darkness is dispelled.

**Magic Resistance**. The councilor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spellcasting.** The councilor is a 13th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following cleric spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): [[guidance]], [[mending]], [[sacred flame]], [[spare the dying]], [[thaumaturgy]]
1st level (4 slots): [[bless]], [[command]], [[create or destroy water]]
2nd level (3 slots): [[augury]], [[calm emotions]], [[hold person]]
3rd level (3 slots): [[daylight]], [[dispel magic]], [[spirit guardians]]
4th level (3 slots): [[banishment]], [[divination]], [[guardian of faith]]
5th level (2 slots): [[dispel evil and good]], [[flame strike]] (see "Actions" below), [[scrying]]
6th level (1 slots): [[forbiddance]], [[planar ally]]
7th level (1 slots): [[plane shift]]

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The councilor makes two Radiant Touch attacks.

**Radiant Touch**. _Melee Spell Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) radiant damage.

**Healing Touch (3/Day)**. The councilor touches another creature. The target magically regains 18 ([[3d8 + 5) hit points and is freed from one curse afflicting it (councilor's choice).

**Flame Strike (5th-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot)**. The councilor chooses a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the councilor casts this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (its choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.

##### Legendary Actions
**Touch**. The councilor makes one attack with its Radiant Touch.

**Shimmering Aura (Costs 2 Actions)**. The councilor channels positive energy into its Aura of Radiance. Until the end of the councilor's next turn, it sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Any creature that starts its turn in the bright light must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the end of the councilor's next turn.
