Champions are mighty warriors who have honed their fighting skills in wars or gladiatorial pits. To soldiers and other people who fight for a living, champions are as influential as nobles, and their presence is courted as a sign of status among rulers.

A typical champion bears a coat of arms, heraldry that is associated with the champion far and wide. You may create a coat of arms for a champion or roll on the Champion's Coats of Arms table to determine it.
