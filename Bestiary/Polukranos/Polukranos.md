### Polukranos
_Gargantuan monstrosity, unaligned_

![[Polukranos token.png]]

Polukranos, called the World Eater, is the mortal manifestation of the eternal ideal of a hydra. In its first incarnation, it fell from Nyx to the mortal world, and so great were its size and strength that the gods Nylea and Heliod combined their power to bind the monster deep within the Nessian Wood. That incarnation was slain, but the eternal ideal remains. A new incarnation of the World Eater is a fearsome omen, as the monster only appears when the pillars of the world tremble and terrible things are afoot in the realm of the gods. Its rampages often presage an age of menace for all civilization.

What krakens are to the sea and dragons are to the sky, hydras are to the lands of Theros. Various hydras dwell at the fringes of civilization, from the bog-dwelling hydras known across the multiverse to massive ironscale hydras that lurk in deep wildernesses. Beyond even these exist serpentine horrors born of the whims of foul gods, like the legendary hydra Polukranos.

**Acidic Blood**. When Polukranos takes piercing or slashing damage, each creature within 5 feet of Polukranos takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.

**Hold Breath**. Polukranos can hold its breath for 1 hour.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Polukranos fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Multiple Heads**. Polukranos has five heads. While it has more than one head, Polukranos has advantage on saving throws against being [[blinded]], [[charmed]], [[deafened]], [[frightened]], [[stunned]], or knocked [[unconscious]]. Whenever Polukranos takes 40 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, Polukranos dies. At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken 40 or more fire damage since its last turn. Polukranos regains 20 hit points for each head regrown in this way.

**Reactive Heads**. For each head Polukranos has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only to make opportunity attacks.

**Wakeful**. While Polukranos sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.
