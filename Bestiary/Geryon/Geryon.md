### Geryon
_Huge fiend (devil), lawful evil_

![[Geryon.webp]]

Geryon is locked in an endless struggle with Levistus for control of Stygia. The two have fought for centuries, each displacing the other innumerable times. Currently, Levistus claims lordship over Stygia, but he has been trapped in an enormous block of ice at the command of Asmodeus. In response, Geryon is marshaling his followers, hoping to use this opportunity to replace his hated rival.

Among the archdevils, Geryon is known for his martial prowess. He is a ferocious hunter and a relentless tracker. He often joins his troops in battle; he loves to feel flesh and steel sundered beneath his claws and to taste his foes' blood. Yet Geryon's ferocity has also limited his ability to collect souls and forge an effective hierarchy. Sages who study the Nine Hells believe the battle for control of Stygia is a test staged by Asmodeus in hopes of purging the worst impulses from both Geryon and Levistusâ€”or discovering a competent replacement for both.

**Geryon's Lair** Geryon has recently reclaimed his ancient fortress, Coldsteel, a sprawling complex that rises from the icy center of Stygia. He roams the passages, spitting oaths of vengeance against Asmodeus and hatching schemes to reclaim his standing from Levistus. The challenge rating of Geryon is 23 (50,000 XP) when he's encountered in his lair.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Geryon fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. Geryon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. Geryon's weapon attacks are magical.

**Regeneration**. Geryon regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Geryon dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Innate Spellcasting.** Geryon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 21). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Geryon makes two attacks: one with his claws and one with his stinger.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d6 + 9) slashing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (DC 24) and is [[restrained]] until the grapple ends. Geryon can grapple one creature at a time. If the target is already [[grappled]] by Geryon, the target takes an extra 27 (6d8) slashing damage.

**Stinger**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (2d4 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 13 (2d12) poison damage and become [[poisoned]] until it finishes a short or long rest. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to half the poison damage it takes. If its hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies. This reduction lasts until the [[poisoned]] condition is removed.

**Teleport**. Geryon magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

##### Legendary Actions
**Infernal Glare**. Geryon targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. If the target can see Geryon, the target must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] of Geryon until the end of its next turn.

**Swift Sting (Costs 2 Actions)**. Geryon attacks with his stinger.

**Teleport**. Geryon uses his Teleport action.
