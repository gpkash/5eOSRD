Myconids are intelligent, mobile fungi that live in caves, seek enlightenment, and dislike violence. Adult myconids live and work together in colonies and practice a form of communal meditation called a meld, in which they seek to transcend mundane reality through shared hallucination.

Myconid leaders like Sinensa use their Hallucination Spores to help myconids create melds.

**Distress Spores**. When the myconid takes damage, all other myconids within 240 feet of it can sense its pain.

**Sun Sickness**. While in sunlight, the myconid has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The myconid uses either its Hallucination Spores or its Pacifying Spores, then makes a fist attack.

**Fist**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (3d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) poison damage.

**Animating Spores (3/Day)**. The myconid targets one corpse of a humanoid or a Large or smaller beast within 5 feet of it and releases spores at the corpse. In 24 hours, the corpse rises as a spore servant. The corpse stays animated for [[1d4 + 1 weeks or until destroyed, and it can't be animated again in this way.

**Hallucination Spores**. The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. The [[poisoned]] target is [[incapacitated]] while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Pacifying Spores**. The myconid ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Rapport Spores**. A 30-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.
