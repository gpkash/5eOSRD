### Riffler
_Small fey, chaotic neutral_

![[Riffler.jpg]]

Rifflers are diminutive Fey reminiscent of gnomes and obsessed with destiny and fate. The oldest stories of rifflers suggest these dangerously curious spirits manifested as physical beings when the Deck of Many Things was shuffled for the first time. The rifflers were so enraptured with the soft sound made by the whispering cards that they made physical bodies for themselves in order to possess and understand this new instrument of destiny.

Rifflers wander the Feywild and Material Plane, searching for Decks of Many Things. They collect the cards, trade them, hoard them, and scatter them across worlds, all in service of an incomprehensible agenda to manipulate the fate of the multiverse. Rifflers are as likely to give a deck to adventurers in dire need as they are to wrest cards from an innocent person by any means necessary.

Both the Solar Bastion (see chapter 10) and the Grim Harrow (see chapter 19) know of rifflers and their obsession with Decks of Many Things, and these organizations stay alert for signs of these Fey creatures, since that usually means a deck is nearby.

**Card Sense**. The riffler can smell the presence of magical cards, including Decks of Many Things and other magical decks, within 1 mile of itself. It knows the direction to any such cards in that range. Effects that protect a target from divination magic block this sense.

**Riffling Step**. The riffler can burrow through any nonmagical material that isn't iron, shuffling the substance through which the riffler moves aside like cards to form a tunnel that closes behind the riffler.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The riffler makes two Spectral Card attacks.

**Spectral Card**. _Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) force damage plus 5 (1d10) damage that is radiant if the d10 roll is an even number and necrotic if it's odd.

**Card Spray Recharge 5-6**. The riffler magically unleashes a spray of spectral cards in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (5d10) force damage and has the [[restrained]] condition for 1 minute as cards bind it. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A [[restrained]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Plane Shift**. The riffler casts the [[Plane Shift]] spell targeting only itself, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability.

#### Reactions
**Shuffle Destiny**. When a creature the riffler can see within 30 feet of itself makes an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, the riffler can magically force that creature to roll a d6 and either add the number rolled to the total or subtract it from the total (riffler's choice), potentially changing the outcome.
