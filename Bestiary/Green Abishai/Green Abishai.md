**Devil's Sight**. Magical darkness doesn't impede the abishai's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance**. The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. The abishai's weapon attacks are magical.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The abishai's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The abishai makes two attacks, one with its claws and one with its longsword, or it casts one spell from its Innate Spellcasting trait and makes one claw attack.

**Longsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage, or 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison damage and become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. The [[poisoned]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
