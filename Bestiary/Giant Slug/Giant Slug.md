**Keen Smell**. The slug has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Spider Climb**. The slug can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The slug's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 11, +3 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The slug makes two attacks: one with its tentacles and one with its bite.

**Tentacles**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is [[paralyzed]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poison on itself on a success.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage.

#### Reactions
**Animate Tentacle**. When the slug takes damage in this cave ([[Shrine of Umberlee]]), it can use its reaction to animate one of the tentacles of the kraken statue and cause it to   make a melee weapon attack (+3 to hit) against one creature within 20 feet of the statue that the slug can see. The tentacle deals 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a hit.
