_Huge undead, lawful evil_

![[Zikzokrishka.jpg]]

**Zikzokrishka's Phylactery** Zikzokrishka hid her phylactery deep within the Scimitar Spires, a mountain range to the east of the necropolis of Azumar. If the characters defeat her, Zikzokrishka uses her phylactery to rematerialize, having long ago prepared a dragon's corpse to house her spirit upon its return to the phylactery.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Zikzokrishka fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. Zikzokrishka has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Zikzokrishka can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence**. Each creature of Zikzokrishka's choice that is within 120 feet of the Zikzokrishka and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Zikzokrishka's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Lightning Breath Recharge 5-6**. Zikzokrishka exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

##### Legendary Actions

After beating its wings this way, Zikzokrishka can fly up to half its flying speed.
