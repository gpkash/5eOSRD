**Action Surge (2/[[Short Rest]])**. Once on his turn, Percy can take one additional action.

**Cabal's Ruin**. [[Cabal's Ruin (Exalted)|Cabal's Ruin]] grants Percy advantage on saving throws against spells or magical effects. Additionally, [[Cabal's Ruin (Exalted)|Cabal's Ruin]] has 10 charges. When Percy hits with a weapon attack, he can expend up to 10 charges to have the attack deal 1d6 extra lightning damage per charge spent.

**Indomitable (3/[[Long Rest]])**. Percy can reroll a failed saving throws.

**Misfire**. When Percy rolls a 2 or lower on the d20 when making an attack with Animus or Bad News, the attack misses and he can't use the weapon again until he spends an action to repair it. On a misfire with Animus, he takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage.

**No Mercy**. Percy's weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.

**Ranged Master**. Percy's ranged weapon attacks have a +2 bonus to hit (included in attacks), ignore [[half cover]] and [[three-quarters cover]], and have no range penalty. Additionally, Percy can take a âˆ’5 penalty to any ranged attack roll to gain a +10 bonus to the damage roll.

**Special Equipment**. Percy wears a [[Ring of Lightning Resistance]] and [[Cabal's Ruin (Exalted)|Cabal's Ruin]]. He wields Animus and Bad News, which are both +1 weapons.

**Quick Draw**. Percy adds his proficiency bonus to initiative rolls, giving him a +12 to initiative rolls.

**Toughness**. Percy has an additional 40 hit points.

#### Reactions
**Absorb Magic (Recharges after a [[Short Rest]] or [[Long Rest]])**. When Percy is targeted by an enemy's spell, he can absorb a portion of the spell's energy into [[Cabal's Ruin (Exalted)|Cabal's Ruin]]. The spell affects him normally, but the cloak gains a number of charges equal to the level of the spell. When he does so, he also gains resistance to one type of damage dealt by the spell until the end of his next turn.
