### War Priest
_Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment_

![[War Priest.jpg]]

War priests worship deities of war, protection, and strategy. They plan tactics, lead soldiers into battle, confront enemy spellcasters, and tend to casualties. A war priest might command an army or serve as the right hand of a [[warlord|MPMM]] (appears in [[this book|MPMM]]) on the battlefield.

War priests typically adorn themselves with a symbol of their faith. You can roll on the War Priest Holy Symbols table below, or choose one that fits your campaign.
