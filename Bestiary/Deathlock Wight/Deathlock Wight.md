**Sunlight Sensitivity**. While in sunlight, the wight has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The wight's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no verbal or material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The wight attacks twice with Grave Bolt.

**Grave Bolt**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) necrotic damage.

**Life Drain**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a [[zombie]] under the wight's control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve [[zombie||zombies]] under its control at one time.
