### Strahd's Animated Armor
_Medium construct, lawful evil_

![[Strahd's Animated Armor.webp]]

The armor that Strahd wore into battle when he was alive lives on today as a headless, animated suit of plate armor. The armor is painted burgundy and adorned with golden angelic motifs.

**Thing of Evil** Strahd imbued his automaton with a sliver of his being, bequeathing unto his armor a malevolence not found in most animated objects. He also fortified his armor and placed a number of permanent spell effects on it to make the armor a better castle defender.

The armor understands Common but obeys only the commands of its master.

**Constructed Nature**. An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

**Antimagic Susceptibility**. The armor is [[incapacitated]] while in the area of an [[antimagic field]]. If targeted by [[dispel magic]], the armor must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall [[unconscious]] for 1 minute.

**False Appearance**. While the armor remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal suit of armor.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The armor makes two melee attacks or uses Shocking Bolt twice.

**Greatsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning damage.

**Shocking Bolt**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +4 to hit (with advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal), range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) lightning damage.
