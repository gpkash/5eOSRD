**Burden of Time**. Beasts and Humanoids (except elves) have disadvantage on saving throws while within 10 feet of the shadar-kai.

**Fey Ancestry**. The shadar-kai has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put it to sleep.

**Spellcasting.** The shadar-kai casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The shadar-kai makes three Shadow Spear attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Shadow Spear**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120, one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 26 (4d12) necrotic damage. Hit or Miss: The spear magically returns to the shadar-kai's hand immediately after a ranged attack.

#### Reactions
**Misty Escape Recharge 6-6**. When the shadar-kai takes damage, it turns [[invisible]] and teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It remains [[invisible]] until the start of its next turn or until it attacks or casts a spell.
