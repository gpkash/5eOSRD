### Kolyarut
_Medium construct (inevitable), lawful neutral_

![[Kolyarut.webp]]

Created by Primus, the leader of the modrons, the Kolyarut is a wondrous machine capable of forging binding contracts between parties. From the Hall of Concordance in Sigil, the Kolyarut judges the needs of planar beings seeking uniquely binding terms and forges ironclad agreements. Those who break these contracts are pursued by maruts (detailed in[[Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse]]) and punished in brutally decisive fashion.

In cases where the terms of a contract or a foundational truth of an agreement come into question, the Kolyarut sends a component part of itself into the planes to seek the truth. Also known as kolyaruts, these manifestations of the great machine function as multiversal investigators and pursue answers to specific quandaries. Once their questions have been satisfied, they report back to their creator, allowing the Kolyarut to impose accurate judgments.

Kolyaruts are four-armed beings of magic and machinery. Like maruts, they are inevitables, beings dedicated to the smooth exaction of laws across the planes. Kolyaruts wield blades with deadly efficiency, allowing them to defend themselves on their excursions and slice through any who obscure the truth.

Occasionally, the Hall of Concordance loans kolyaruts to lawful beings who have inherent interest in the orderly functioning of the multiverse, aiding them in seeking answers of planar importance.
