**Mental Fortitude**. The neogi has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]], and magic can't put the neogi to sleep.

**Spider Climb**. The neogi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Spellcasting.** The neogi is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It regains its expended spell slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the following warlock spells:

Cantrips (at will): [[eldritch blast]] (range 300 ft., +4 bonus to each damage roll), [[guidance]], [[mage hand]], [[minor illusion]], [[prestidigitation]], [[vicious mockery]]
4th level (2 slots): [[arms of Hadar]], [[counterspell]], [[dimension door]], [[fear]], [[hold person]], [[hunger of Hadar]], [[invisibility]], [[unseen servant]]

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The neogi makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.

**Enslave (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. The neogi targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [[charmed]] by the neogi for 1 day, or until the neogi dies or is more than 1 mile from the target. The [[charmed]] target obeys the neogi's commands and can't take reactions, and the neogi and the target can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to 1 mile. Whenever the [[charmed]] target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
