Several new zombie variants are presented below. For more information on zombies, see the Monster Manual.

**Ankylosaurus Zombie** This creature is slow and barely aware of its surroundings.


**Girallon Zombie** Girallons are four-armed apes with white fur. Girallon zombies are slower than their non-undead counterparts but no less fierce. The necromantic energy empowering them fuels their murderous hearts and their hunger for living flesh.


**Tyrannosaurus Zombie** A tyrannosaurus zombie has a gullet full of smaller zombies, which it can disgorge. These zombies aren't under the tyrannosaurus zombie's control.

**Disgorge Zombie**. As a bonus action, the tyrannosaurus zombie can disgorge a normal [[zombie]], which appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. The disgorged [[zombie]] acts on its own initiative count. After a zombie is disgorged, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, the tyrannosaurus zombie runs out of zombies to disgorge and loses this trait. If the tyrannosaurus zombie still has this trait when it dies, 1d4 normal zombies erupt from its corpse at the start of its next turn. These zombies act on their own initiative count.

**Undead Fortitude**. If damage reduces the tyrannosaurus zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The tyrannosaurus zombie makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 33 (4d12 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]] and the tyrannosaurus zombie can't bite another target or disgorge zombies.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.
