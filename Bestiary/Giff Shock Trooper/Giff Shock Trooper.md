**Firearms Knowledge**. The giff's mastery of its weapons enables it to ignore the loading property of any firearm.

**Headfirst Charge**. If the giff moves at least 20 feet in a straight line and ends within 5 feet of a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [[prone]].

**Siege Monster**. The giff deals double damage to objects and structures.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The giff makes two Greatsword or Musket attacks.

**Greatsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.

**Musket**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d12 + 2) piercing damage.

**Thunder Bomb**. The giff lights a grapefruit-sized bomb and throws it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the giff throws the bomb, roll a d6; on a roll of 4 or lower, the giff has no more bombs to throw.
