### Istrid Horn
_Medium humanoid (dwarf), lawful evil_

![[Istrid Horn.webp]]

Istrid is regarded as the Black Network's Master of Trade and Coin in Waterdeep. The shield dwarf operates an illegal lending operation out of a heavily guarded warehouse in the Dock Ward, offering loans to those in need of coin. Her interest rates are comparable to those of her competitors (including noble families of bankers such as the Cassalanters and the Irlingstars), but the penalties for not paying back Istrid's loans are severe.

Istrid worships Vergadain, the dwarven god of wealth and luck. She likes having others indebted to her, and she employs thugs and enforcers to collect on her loans. If those resources prove inadequate, Istrid can call on her old adventuring companions for assistance.


**The Doom Raiders** The Doom Raiders were five unscrupulous adventurers who liked to plunder lich lairs (called "dooms" by some). They gave up adventuring to join the Black Network and came to Waterdeep three years ago with plans to establish a Zhentarim foothold in the city. In that time, they have forged alliances with various nobles and guilds and run afoul of others, all the while fending off Harper spies.
