### Foresworn
_Medium undead, lawful good_

![[Foresworn.webp]]

Foresworn are the spirits of fallen Solamnic knights who attend to their duty long after death. Armed with spectral armor and weaponry, a foresworn maintains the martial prowess it had in life and can call on magic and its fallen brethren for aid.

Like revenants, foresworn fixate on a singular purpose, and they refuse to abandon their undead state until the duty they had in life is fulfilled. For example, a foresworn might be pledged to protect a family's bloodline from harm or guard a dangerous artifact against thieves. If a foresworn is destroyed before it can complete its duty, it returns within a few days, its strength and purpose renewed.
