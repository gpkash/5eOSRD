### Stonemelder
_Medium humanoid (human), neutral evil_

![[Stonemelder token.png]]

Stonemelders are spellcasters who gain their power from Ogrémoch, using elemental earth magic to sheathe their bodies in carapaces of rock. They are elite champions of the cult and answer only to the cult leaders. Not even the Black Earth priests tell stonemelders what to do.

Each stonemelder carries a weapon known as a Black Earth rod. Such a rod is like an ordinary mace, but in the hands of a stonemelder, it serves as a conduit for Ogrémoch's wrath.
