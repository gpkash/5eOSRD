### Skeletal Alchemist
_Medium undead, lawful evil_

![[Skeletal Alchemist.jpg]]

This undead retains enough of its former self to continue its alchemical work, often on behalf of necromancers or other sinister patrons. It toils in a dark laboratory (such as the one found in The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh), often falling dormant for long periods of time.
