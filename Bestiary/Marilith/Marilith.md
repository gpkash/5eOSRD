**Magic Resistance**. The marilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. The marilith's weapon attacks are magical.

**Reactive**. The marilith can take one reaction on every turn in combat.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The marilith can make seven attacks: six with its longswords and one with its tail.

**Longsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], the marilith can automatically hit the target with its tail, and the marilith can't make tail attacks against other targets.

**Teleport**. The marilith magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

#### Reactions
**Parry**. The marilith adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the marilith must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
