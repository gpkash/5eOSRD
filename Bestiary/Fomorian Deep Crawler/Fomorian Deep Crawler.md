**Contortionist**. The fomorian can enter a space large enough for a Large creature without squeezing.

**Crawling Stance**. While the fomorian has the [[prone]] condition, crawling does not cost it extra movement. In addition, the [[prone]] condition does not grant advantage on attack rolls against the fomorian.

**Spider Climb**. The fomorian can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The fomorian makes two Slam attacks and uses Crawling Hex if it is available.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Crawling Hex Recharge 4-6**. The fomorian targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 31 (7d8) psychic damage, have the [[prone]] condition, and become cursed for 1 hour. While cursed this way, the target can't stand up and end the [[prone]] condition on itself.
