**Divine Custodian**. When the golem hits a creature with an [[ opportunity attack]], that creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.

**Immutable Form**. The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance**. The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. The golem's weapon attacks are magical.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The golem makes two melee attacks.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) piercing damage.

**Mace**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Radiant Blast Recharge 6**. The golem emits a burst of radiant light in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throws. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8) radiant damage and is [[blinded]] until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and is not [[blinded]].

#### Reactions
**Divine Judgment**. When a creature within 10 feet of the golem makes an attack against a target other than the golem, the golem can make a mace attack against that creature.
