### Squirt the Oilcan
_Tiny construct, chaotic neutral_

![[Squirt the Oilcan.jpg]]

**Roleplaying Notes** Originally a nonsentient oilcan, Squirt was carried to the Feywild by dwarves hoping to harvest boggle oil. Though the expedition was a success, the dwarves were put to sleep by pixie magic. During a celebration that erupted around them, an elf used her magic to animate the oilcan in jest. Having come alive at a party, Squirt was imbued with the urge to seek out fun wherever it can be found.

**Alignment** Chaotic neutral.


**Personality Trait** "Why do something yourself when you can have someone else do it for you?"


**Ideal** "No use sitting about getting rusty when there's fun to be had. Let's party!"


**Bond** "I'm running on fumes here. I need oil."


**Flaw** "I'm too tired to fly today. You carry me."

**False Appearance**. If Squirt is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed Squirt move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that Squirt is animate.

**Unusual Nature**. Squirt doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

##### Actions
**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

**Boggle Oil (3 Applications)**. Squirt expends 1 application of boggle oil to create a 10-foot-square puddle of slippery, non-flammable oil on the ground within 5 feet of it. The puddle is [[difficult terrain]] and lasts for 1 hour. Each creature that enters the puddle's area or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall [[prone]]. Boggles are unaffected by the oil. After it expends all 3 applications, Squirt can't use this action again until its supply of boggle oil is replenished.
