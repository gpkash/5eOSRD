**Fey Ancestry**. The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

**Sunlight Sensitivity**. While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

**Spellcasting.** The drow casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The drow makes two Scimitar attacks and one Whip or Hand Crossbow attack.

**Scimitar**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage.

**Whip**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage.

**Hand Crossbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [[unconscious]] while [[poisoned]] in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it.

#### Reactions
**Parry**. The drow adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack roll that would hit it. To do so, the drow must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
