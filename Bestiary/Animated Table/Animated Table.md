### Animated Table
_Large construct, unaligned_

![[Animated Table.webp]]

**Arundil's Animated Objects** A century ago, the dwarf mage Arundil animated a number of objects to defend the Foundry against intruders other than dwarves. Many of these creations remain in place today.

These animated objects never attack dwarves or duergar. In addition, a dwarf (including a duergar) can order an object to cease its attack. If so commanded, the object becomes immobile for 10 minutes, or until the one commanding it leaves the area.

**Constructed Nature** An animated table doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Antimagic Susceptibility**. The table is [[incapacitated]] while in the area of an [[antimagic field]]. If targeted by [[dispel magic]], the table must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall [[unconscious]] for 1 minute.

**False Appearance**. While the table remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal table.

**Charge**. If the table moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

##### Actions
**Ram**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
