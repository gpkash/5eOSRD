### Wasteland Dragonnel
_Large dragon, chaotic good_

![[Wasteland Dragonnel token.png]]

The Northern Wastes of Ansalon are home to wasteland dragonnels, draconic creatures closely related to copper dragons. Wasteland dragonnels are lithe and quick, with scales the color of dull copper. These playful creatures defend their territory by flying out of a foe's reach and spitting potent acid, in an approximation of their copper dragon relatives.


**Dragonnels** Dragonnels are distantly related to chromatic and metallic dragons and resemble them in basic form. Intelligent enough to understand speech but incapable of speaking themselves, they are willful creatures largely motivated by the desire for food.
