##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The deep spider makes two foreleg attacks and one bite attack.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]] in this way.

**Foreleg**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) slashing damage.
