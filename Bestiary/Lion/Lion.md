**Keen Smell**. The lion has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Pack Tactics**. The lion has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the lion's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Pounce**. If the lion moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].
