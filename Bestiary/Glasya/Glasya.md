### Glasya
_Medium fiend (devil), lawful evil_

![[Glasya.jpg]]

Glasya is known by many names: the Dark Prodigy, the Princess of the Nine Hells, and Lord of Malbolge. She maintains control over the erinyes and has a massive following within the downtrodden and the neglected royalty of the other planes. For a long time, she was simply a lesser archdevil, jumping between various courts as she saw fit. It wasn't until the Reckoning, which she helped instigate, that she claimed true power and became ruler of one of the nine layers.

Asmodeus, her father, and Glasya share much in common—particularly their cunning, ambition, and "dedication" to laws. Because of this, despite some of the hatred Glasya has towards her father, the two share a relationship of respect and support.

Even though she busies herself with many important undertakings to further cement her power, being surrounded by beautiful things is also important to Glasya. Similarly, she detests the ugly, punishing those she sees as disgusting. During her brief relationship with Mammon, she was rarely found in his swampy domain, choosing instead to roam other layers. Almost everything that interacts with Glasya either deeply loves or loathes her. She maintains a charming persona, often even converting spies from other archdevils to her side.

Perhaps contributing to her obsession with beauty, Glasya herself is considered stunning. Her jet-black hair and copper skin hide her infernal nature, though her large, leathery wings and small horns give it away. Due to her ability to polymorph at will, she can meet various other standards of beauty as well, always maintaining an outward charm—which helps conceal her foul core.

**Glasya's Lair** Glasya built her fortress lair, Ossiea, from the grotesquely enlarged and distorted skull of Malagard. Behind the walls of the skull, there are numerous opulent levels, within which Glasya conducts the business of ruling her realm or indulges her other interests.

**Charm Aura**. When a creature moves to be within 120 feet of Glasya, they must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[charmed]] condition, treating Glasya as an ally, until they leave the aura. A creature that succeeds the saving throw is immune to this effect for 1 hour. Whenever a [[charmed]] creature takes damage, they may repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

**Dominating Presence**. Glasya deals an additional 13 (2d12) psychic damage when attacking a [[charmed]] creature, and her attacks don't break charms.

**Fiendish Regeneration**. Glasya regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn. If she takes radiant damage this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn. Glasya dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and is unable to regenerate. If Glasya is killed, her body slowly regenerates, returning to life 9 (2d8) weeks later.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Glasya fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. Glasya has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Glasya makes four attacks using Scourge of Shadow, Necrotic Grasp, or a combination of the two. She can replace one of the attacks with Mesmerizing Gaze.

**Scourge of Shadow**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +20 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d4 + 12) slashing damage, plus 5 (2d4) necrotic damage. This attack scores a critical on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.

**Necrotic Grasp**. Glasya summons necrotic hands to grope and claw at a creature she can see within 90 feet of her. The target must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, taking 20 (2d10 + 9) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Mesmerizing Gaze**. Glasya focuses her gaze in a 60-foot cone in front of her. Each creature of her choice within the cone must make a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or have the [[charmed]] condition until the end of their next turn. While [[charmed]], creatures automatically fail saving throws from abilities used by Glasya and move to be as close to her as possible.

**Deathly Exclamation (1/Day)**. Glasya targets a creature she can see within 60 feet of her. The target must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, taking 61 (7d8 + 30) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid killed by this ability rises at the start of Glasya's next turn as a zombie permanently under her command.

##### Legendary Actions
**Whip**. Glasya makes a Scourge of Shadow attack.

**Disorient (Costs 2 Actions)**. Glasya casts [[Confusion]] (30-foot-ra- dius, spell save DC 25), but only lasting until the end of Glasya's next turn.

**Call Underling (Costs 3 Actions)**. Glasya summons an allied [[erinyes]] in an unoccupied space that she can see.
