**Axiomatic Mind**. The hexton can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

**Combat Ready**. The hexton has advantage on initiative rolls.

**Disintegration**. If the hexton dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind anything it was carrying.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day)**. If the hexton fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Spellcasting.** The hexton casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The hexton makes one Pincer attack and two Tentacle attacks.

**Pincer**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [[incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn.

**Tentacle**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the hexton can't use this tentacle against other targets. The hexton has six tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

#### Reactions
**Counter Magic**. The hexton attempts to interrupt a creature it can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 4th level or higher, the hexton makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect.

**Lightning Rebuke**. When a creature within 120 feet of the hexton damages it, the hexton magically retaliates with an arc of lightning. The creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
