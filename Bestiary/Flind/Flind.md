### Flind
_Medium humanoid (gnoll), chaotic evil_

![[Flind.webp]]

When the demon lord Yeenoghu wants to create a particularly fearsome war band leader, he transforms an excep tionally strong and vicious gnoll into a demonic warrior known as a flind.

A war band of demon-worshiping gnolls typically contains only one flind, and that creature sets the war band's path. Because of its special connection to Yeenoghu, a flind uses demonic insight to guide the gnolls toward weak prey ripe for slaughter.

Unlike other leaders who might skulk behind their minions, a flind leads the charge in battle. Its flail causes wracking pain, paralysis, and disorientation in those it strikes.

**Multiattack**. The flind makes three attacks: one with each of its different flail attacks or three with its longbow.

**Flail of Madness**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.
