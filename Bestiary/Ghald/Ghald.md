### Ghald
_Large humanoid (sahuagin), lawful evil_

![[Ghald.jpg]]

Ghald is an 8-foot-tall, four-armed sahuagin who works with a partner, Unferth, for the Kraken Society in Yartar. He's careful not to emerge from his hiding place beneath the docks unless it's dark and rainy, and even then he hides under a bulky cloak. He and Unferth serve as the Kraken Society's top operatives in this part of the North, and specialize in advancing the agenda of the society through theft, intimidation, and assassination.

When the thieves' guild known as the Hand of Yartar comes into possession of a powerful elemental weapon (see the "Dark Dealings in Yartar" side trek in chapter 6), Ghald and Unferth make sure the Kraken Society comes in with the top bid. They then make sure that no one else interferes.

**Assassinate**. During its first turn, Ghald has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Ghald scores against a [[surprise|surprised]] creature is a critical hit.

**Limited Amphibiousness**. Ghald can breathe air and water, but he needs to be submerged at least once every 4 hours to avoid suffocating.

**Shark Telepathy**. Ghald can magically command any shark within 120 feet of him, using a limited telepathy.

**Sneak Attack**. Ghald deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Ghald's that isn't [[incapacitated]] and Ghald doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Ghald makes three attacks, one with his bite and two with his shortswords.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage.

**Shortsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

**Garrote**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or Small creature against which Ghald has advantage on the attack roll. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target can't breathe, and Ghald has advantage on attack rolls against it.
