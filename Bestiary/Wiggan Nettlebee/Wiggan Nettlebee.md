### Wiggan Nettlebee
_Small humanoid (halfling), neutral evil_

![[Wiggan Nettlebee.jpg]]

Wiggan Nettlebee is the patriarch of the Nettlebee clan, a wealthy family of halflings that raise livestock and farm their land. He presents the outward appearance of a modest rancher, and he forbids extravagance on his farm. Thinking he had found a cult dedicated to the dominating nature and utilizing its darker aspects, Wiggan joined the Cult of the Black Earth. He still doesn't know the full extent of the cult's plans.

Wiggan dislikes and distrusts outsiders. He believes they are all evildoers who would steal from him if they could. He sees the earth cult as a powerful and necessary ally toward securing his finances and sustaining his position. A greedy miser, Wiggan becomes visibly upset at the thought of parting with even a few spare coins from his hoard.
