_Medium humanoid (kenku, warlock), chaotic neutral_

![[Kettlesteam the Kenku.jpg]]

Kettlesteam the kenku snoops around the carnival under the cover of a [[disguise self]] spell, looking to cause trouble. The kenku has stolen the voice of a human mime named Candlefoot (see "Hall of Illusions "earlier in the chapter). While this prize remains in her possession, Kettlesteam can speak clearly in Candlefoot's soft, silky voice.
