**Freedom of Movement**. The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be [[restrained]]. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or grapples.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If the kraken fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Siege Monster**. The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The kraken makes two attacks using its Tentacle, Fling, or a combination of the two.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d6 + 8) piercing damage and 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature [[grappled]] by the kraken, the creature is swallowed and the grapple ends. While swallowed, a creature has the [[blinded]] and [[restrained]] conditions, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and takes 42 (12d6) fire damage at the start of the kraken's turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall into a space within 10 feet of the kraken and now have the [[prone]] condition. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting with the [[prone]] condition.

**Tentacle**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d4 + 8) fire damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16). While [[grappled]], the target also has the [[restrained]] condition. Any target that starts its turn [[grappled]] by the kraken takes 5 (2d4) fire damage. The kraken has five tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Fling**. One Large or smaller object or creature [[grappled]] by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction, and now has the [[prone]] condition. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked down with the [[prone]] condition.

##### Legendary Actions
**Appendage**. The kraken makes a Fling attack.

**Fire Breath (Costs 3 Actions)**. The kraken exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
