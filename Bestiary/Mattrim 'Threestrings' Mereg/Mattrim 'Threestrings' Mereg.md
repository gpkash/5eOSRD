**Spellcasting.** The bard casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The bard makes two Shortsword or Shortbow attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Shortsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

**Shortbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

**Cacophony Recharge 4-6**. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from the bard must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the bard. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
