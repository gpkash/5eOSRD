### Ruin Grinder
_Large construct, unaligned_

![[Ruin Grinder.jpg]]

Created by the archaeomancers of Lorehold College, ruin grinders are mighty automatons built to excavate ancient ruins and artifacts. The massive toothed shovels attached to a ruin grinder's arms tear through millennia-old bedrock with ease, leading some Lorehold mages to fear that the grinders destroy more history than they unearth.
