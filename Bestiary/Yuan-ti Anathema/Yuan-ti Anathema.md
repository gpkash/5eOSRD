### Yuan-ti Anathema
_Huge monstrosity (shapechanger, yuan-ti), neutral evil_

![[Yuan-ti Anathema.webp]]

As part of their quest for godhood, a yuan-ti abomination might perform a ritual that, if successful, transforms them into an even greater form: a yuan-ti anathema. This ritual demands the sacrifice of hundreds of snakes and requires the abomination to bathe in the blood of their enemies. The transformation is quick but painful.

Anathemas consider themselves demigods on the path to greater divinity. They demand obeisance from weaker creatures and use every resource at their disposal to war against neighbors, seeking the captives, sacrifices, glory, and riches the anathemas believe they need to achieve true divinity.

Anathemas don't age, allowing them to pursue their goals until the end of days. Truly powerful ones might rule multiple yuan-ti cities and bring entire regions under their control.

**Magic Resistance**. The anathema has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Ophidiophobia Aura**. Any creature of the anathema's choice, other than a snake or a yuan-ti, that starts its turn within 30 feet of the anathema and can see or hear it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] of snakes and yuan-ti. A [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this aura for the next 24 hours.

**Shapechanger**. The anathema can use its action to polymorph into a Huge giant constrictor snake, or back into its true form. its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.

**Six Heads**. The anathema has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks and on saving throws against being [[blinded]]. [[charmed]], [[deafened]], [[frightened]], [[stunned]], or knocked [[unconscious]].
