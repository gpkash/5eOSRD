##### Actions
**Shortsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) psychic damage.

**Arcane Blast Recharge 5-6**. The initiate creates an explosion of magical force in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 10 (3d6) force damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the center of the area. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
