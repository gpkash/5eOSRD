### Oculorb
_Large aberration, chaotic evil_

![[Oculorb.jpg]]

Many oculorbs are dreamed into existence by beholders. The Far Realm's strange power can pervade a beholder's dreams, resulting in the birth of an oculorb.

Oculorbs resemble a slimy conglomeration of eyes in many sizes and shapes. They are dreaded even by the beholders that birth them. An oculorb is a tangle of negative emotionsâ€”the fury, melancholy, and obsession of its creator, all given gruesome, corporeal form. Like a beholder, an oculorb can fire beams of energy from its eyes, but an oculorb's eyes lack the more sophisticated magical nature of a beholder's eyestalks. Instead, an oculorb unleashes powerful waves of energy charged with negative emotions, cowing its foes with despair and ire.

**Magic Resistance**. The oculorb has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Watchful Eyes**. The oculorb has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The oculorb makes two Dreadful Contact attacks or four Eye Beam attacks.

**Dreadful Contact**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) psychic damage, or 25 (6d6 + 4) psychic damage if the target has the [[frightened]] condition.

**Eye Beam**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) psychic damage.

**Antipathic Flood Recharge 5-6**. The oculorb releases a wave of negative emotions, choosing one of the following options:

**Weeping Eyes**. The oculorb weeps, releasing a wave of crushing despair. Each creature within 30 feet of the oculorb must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature's speed is reduced to 0 feet until the end of the oculorb's next turn, and if the creature was [[concentration||concentrating]], its [[concentration]] is broken.

**Withering Glare**. The oculorb's eyes unleash furious scarlet energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (6d10) necrotic damage and has the [[frightened]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[frightened]]. A [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

#### Reactions
**Obsessive Rebuke**. When the oculorb is damaged by a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself, it forces the creature to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
