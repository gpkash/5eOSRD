### Raezil
_Medium humanoid (elf), Neutral or Any Neutral Alignment_

![[Raezil token.png]]

The statue is a petrified high elf named Raezil Uthemar (neutral). Raezil served as Zybilna's spy in other fey courts. She returned from a mission to find nearly everyone in the palace trapped in temporal stasis. When she confronted Kelek and accused him of conspiring to overthrow Zybilna, his cockatrices petrified her.

The name "Iggwilv "means nothing to Raezil, who started working for Zybilna shortly after the archfey carved out her domain in the Feywild. Raezil spends most of her time abroad, in the courts of other archfey, and hasn't kept up on the politics of Prismeer.

Once she is no longer petrified, Raezil is bound by the rule of reciprocity (see "Rules of Conduct "in chapter 2) to help the characters complete any outstanding quests they might have. Raezil comes from a highborn elf family with influence in the Summer Court, making her a useful retainer if the characters choose to remain in the Feywild after their adventures in Prismeer have ended.
