### Coral
_Large fey, chaotic good_

![[Coral.webp]]

Coral lives in the ocean and in the clouds. Cookies are her favorite snack. She has the power to bolster other creatures, and she can bestow upon animals the ability to speak for a short time. When she is upset, her rainbow tail lights up. If she smacks her tail on the ground, magical force spreads outward to engulf an enemy, potentially turning it to dust. When Coral has the hiccups, bubbles shoot from her horn. These bubbles transform into tasty cookies, bursts of glitter, and protective clouds of stinky gas.

**Magic Resistance**. Coral has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Coral makes two Hoof attacks and uses Tail Thump.

**Hoof**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Tail Thump**. Coral slams her tail down, unleashing a burst of magical force toward one creature she can see within 60 feet of her. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (4d10) force damage and has the [[prone]] condition. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target dies, and its body is reduced to fine dust.
