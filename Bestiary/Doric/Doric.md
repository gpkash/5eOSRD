### Doric
_Medium humanoid (druid), neutral good_

![[Doric.webp]]

The tiefling Doric was taken in by a wood elf enclave in Neverwinter Wood after being abandoned as a child, and she guards her adoptive community with nature's ferocity. The Circle of the Moon has taught her to heed her primal instincts, which rarely lead her astray. She can be brusque, but she will fight tooth and nail for a cause she believes in.

Doric has joined the Emerald Enclave, a network of survivalists who tend to the balance between civilization and nature. When the Lord of Neverwinter targeted her woodland home for its resources, Doric rallied the resistance.

**Spellcasting.** Doric casts one of the following spells, using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Doric makes two Shaped Claw or Sling attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Shaped Claw**. _Melee Spell Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**Sling**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

#### Reactions
**Fiery Rebuke (3/Day)**. When Doric is damaged by a creature that she can see within 60 feet of herself, she magically engulfs the creature in flames. The creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) fire damage on failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
