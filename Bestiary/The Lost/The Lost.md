### The Lost
_Medium monstrosity, lawful evil_

![[The Lost.webp]]

**The Lost** The Shadowfell turns visitors around until they become marooned in its twisted landscape. The Lost are representations of the anxiety and fear that people experience when they can't find their way. These sorrowsworn appear as desperate and panicked things.

The Lost try to embrace any creatures they can reach, attempting to find solace in the contact. Aside from the horror of being embraced by such a thing, the victim experiences a flood of fear and panic as its mind buckles under the fury of this assault. The harder the victims' allies fight for release, the worse the experience becomes.

**Sorrowsworn** The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. The sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering that are inherent to the shadowy landscape, and they visit horror on those who stumble into their midst.

**Emotion Given Form** Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress. Some are manifestations of anger; others are loneliness given physical form. Their nature provides a clue both to understanding how they become more powerful and to overcoming them. Giving in to the negative emotions that the sorrowsworn represent causes these entities to grow deadlier. Fighting against these emotions can weaken them and drive them away.

##### Lore

History DC 15: The shifting landscape of the shadowfell confounds even those who know its paths, and in the endless mists travellers often succumb to fear and anxiety, entering a state of panic from which they will never emerge.

Nature DC 15: Those in the embrace of one of the lonely find themselves in a dreadful conundrum, as any harm dealt to their attacker has the potential to be reflected on them, and shoving the lonely off can often inspire it to still greater viciousness.

Nature DC 20: As with many of the sorrowsworn, the fears that afflict the lost seek to escape and take root in other hosts. A creature able to sufficiently still its mind is capable of rebounding this malign force upon the lost, though the constant, terrible wailing makes this no small feat.

##### Tactics

The lost stalks its prey for several hours, allowing itself to be heard while maintaining a great deal of distance. It waits until a group of foes is preoccupied with something else, then charges in, ideally approaching under cover, and attempts to grab the nearest creature like a lost 5-year-old grabbing a stranger at the mall.

Once it has a creature restrained, the lost does nothing unless attacked, at which point it will continue attacking its grappled creature. The lost releases a grappled creature that falls unconscious and pursues the nearest foe that is not incapacitated.
