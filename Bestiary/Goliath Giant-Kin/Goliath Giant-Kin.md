### Goliath Giant-Kin
_Medium humanoid, any alignment_

![[Goliath Giant-Kin.jpg]]

Goliaths are Humanoids distantly related to giants. Infused with the supernatural essence of their ancestors' mountainous home, goliaths have the strength and fortitude to garner a giant's respect. Communities of goliaths who live in close relationship with giants emulate them and are recognized by the giants as kin. These goliath giant-kin often act as liaisons between giant clans and other Humanoids.

Though they rarely stand more than 8 feet tall, goliaths can hold their own in contests of strength with ogres. Goliath giant-kin can also channel the magic of their giant relatives into mighty melee attacks.

Though they are not part of the ordning, goliath giant-kin often revere the divine ancestors of the giants, with a particular affinity for Annam's daughters: Diancastra, Hiatea, and Iallanis. They also tend to extol the same virtues as the giants they live alongside, so goliath giant-kin dwelling near frost giants boast of their might, while those dwelling with stone giants cherish artistry.

> _Few things bring me as much delight as goliaths who strive to celebrate their connection to the magnificent history of giants. When they sing me hymns, their voices are sweetest.

> _â€”Diancastra_
