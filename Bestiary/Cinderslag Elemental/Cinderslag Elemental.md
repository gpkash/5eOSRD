### Cinderslag Elemental
_Large elemental, _

![[CinderslagElementalFluff.webp]]

Cinderslag elementals are pure manifestations of the hatred and furore of the deceased [[Cinder King, Thordak|1|Thordak, the Cinder King]]. Even after his death, the fires of that great red dragon continue to ravage [[Emon|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship]], as places scorched by his corrupting flames are transformed into vitriolic pits of slag and ash that spawn mindless creatures of elemental destruction. Though [[Thordak's Crater|3|7. Thordak's Crater]] in [[Emon|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship]] has mostly been healed by the Fire Ashari of Pyrah, the terrible fires still churning beneath the city give rise to [[cinderslag elemental|cinderslag elementals]], as do other areas where the [[Cinder King's|1|Thordak, the Cinder King]] elemental devastation has left an indelible mark, including the ruins of [[Serpent's Head|3|Serpent's Head]] in the [[Cliffkeep Mountains|3|Cliffkeep Mountains]] and the [[Ashen Gorge|3|Ashen Gorge]] in the [[Stormcrest Mountains|3|Stormcrest Mountains]].

**Gaze of Annihilation** A cinderslag elemental's Molten Gaze unleashes incredible power that can melt steel and stone with a glance. If one of these creatures is allowed to focus its gaze for long periods, or if several elementals work in unison, entire cities can easily be leveled in a tide of molten stone. Fortunately for the people of [[Emon|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship]], [[Thordak's|1|Thordak, the Cinder King]] elemental spawn are mindless and incapable of unified actionâ€”as long as no one is able to bend these creatures to their will.

**Searing Presence**. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the elemental takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.

**Molten Form**. The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In addition, the elemental can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throws or be [[restrained]]. A creature that starts its turn [[restrained]] in this way takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. It can repeat the saving throws at the end of each of its turns, freeing itself on a success.

**Water Susceptibility**. For every 5 feet the elemental moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The elemental makes two slam attacks.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (3d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (1d10) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Molten Gaze**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (6d6) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throws or have one nonmagical item of the elemental's choice that the target is carrying instantly melt or burn to cinders.
