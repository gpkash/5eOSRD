### Dragonborn of Sardior
_Medium humanoid, neutral_

![[Dragonborn of Sardior.jpg]]

Sardior is said to have died in the destruction of the First World. But many believe that Sardior's divine essence survives within every gem dragon. This philosophy is central to the teachings of Sardior's dragonborn champions, who wield psionic power in the service of their mysterious cause. Many of these champions are associated with the Inheritors of the First World (see chapter 3).

Sardior's champions use telekinetic power to move their foes and even carry themselves through the air. Their breath weapon, a blast of heat, is believed to be an echo of long-lost Sardior's breath.


**Dragonborn Champions** The connection between dragonborn and their draconic ancestors manifests in a variety of ways. Some dragonborn identify with a particular kind of dragon and attempt to emulate such dragons' attitudes and behavior. Others consider their draconic heritage—chromatic, metallic, or gem—something like a large extended family. But for dragonborn champions, this bond is spiritual as much as biological, and they devote themselves to their divine ancestor. Dragonborn champions advance the cause of their dragon god among draconic creatures and other folk alike.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Metal objects in that area glow red-hot until the end of the dragonborn's next turn.
