### Baalzebul
_Huge fiend (devil), lawful evil_

![[Baalzebul.jpg]]

Baalzebul, is an archdevil and the lord of Maladomini, the seventh layer of the Nine Hells. He is known as both the Lord of Lies and the Lord of the Flies because his tightly woven web of intrigue traps even the smallest fly. In recent centuries he was cursed with a new hideous form by Asmodeus. This form earned him a new titleâ€”The Slug Archduke.

Baalzebul was originally known as Triel, one of the most powerful and beautiful angels to be found in Celestia. Triel's selfish acts in the name of achieving his perfection resulted in his corruption and exile from Celestia. After his fall, Asmodeus, perhaps out of some lingering sense of sympathy, quickly promoted Baalzebul to the ranks of devilish nobility. Baalzebul's ruthless lust for power served him well and before long he not only displaced the ancient, original Lord of Maladomini but managed to become the only archdevil to rule two layers of the Nine Hells, although he ruled Malbolge through the devil Moloch.

However, Baalzebul's pride continued to be his undoing. When he attempted to take Asmodeus's throne, his schemes were discovered and thwarted.

Asmodeus inflicted a series of bizarre penalties upon Baalzebul. He was cursed to appear as a slug for one year per lie he had told to a devil, and any deal he struck with a mortal would result in a disaster for the participant. His castle was turned to excrement and filled with filth and his dominion of Malbolge was stripped from him.

Despite his punishments, Baalzebul is still dangerously cunning and charismatic. Even while trapped in the form of a slug, he remained the Lord of Lies, whose every deception was made with ease. Every one of his untruths is told with a specific purpose in mind, and only other devils are safe from his lies.

**Baalzebul's Two Forms** When dealing with enemies or unfortunate subordinates, Baalzebul generally manifests as a powerful winged creature. However, the characters are most likely to encounter this archdevil in his slug form after he has incurred Asmodeus's wrath again. The accompanying stat block works for both forms except that Baalzebul's movement in his slug form is replaced with: 20 ft., burrow 20 ft., climb 20 ft.


**Baalzebul's Lair** Baalzebul's lair resides within whichever city is the newest he has constructed.

**Devil's Sight**. Magical darkness doesn't impede Baalzebul's darkvision.

**Decipher Weakness**. Baalzebul scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Baalzebul fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Lord of Flies**. Insects do not attack Baalzebul and as a bonus action he can command any number of them within 50 feet to take move or action attacks.

**Magic Resistance**. Baalzebul has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. Baalzebul's slam attacks are magical.

**Regeneration**. Baalzebul regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Baalzebul dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and is unable to regenerate.

**Stench of the Slug**. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of Baalzebul must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to this stench for 1 hour.

**Undead Mastery**. When casting animate dead, Baalzebul can summon 10 additional zombies or skeletons as long as sufficient corpses are available.

**Innate Spellcasting.** Baalzebul's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Baalzebul uses his Fear and Weakness gaze (if available) and then makes two slam attacks.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (1d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage. Baalzebul's attacks wither the limbs of opponents he strikes. Any creature hit by Baalzebul's slam attack must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. Failure means the target loses the use of their legs (stuck in the [[prone]] position) or their arms (unable to cast spells or engage in attacks; lose any AC bonus from shields). Baalzebul decides whether he targets arms or legs before making the attack roll. This withering effect lasts for one minute but at the end of each of their turns the afflicted creature may repeat the saving throw.

**Fear and Weakness Gaze Recharge 5-6**. Baalzebul activates a gaze attack and triggers two effects on everyone within 50 feet of him. The first requires a DC 21 Charisma saving throw; failure means the target is [[frightened]] of Baalzebul as per the [[fear]] spell. The second effect requires another DC 21 Charisma saving throw. Failure means the target suffers the effects of the [[ray of enfeeblement]] spell. Both effects last one minute.

**Teleport**. Baalzebul magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

**Summon Allies (1/Day)**. Baalzebul summons 1d6 [[horned devil||horned devils]], 1d4 [[ice devil||ice devils]], or 1 [[pit fiend]].

##### Legendary Actions
**Teleport**. Baalzebul uses his Teleport action.

**Insect Gorge (Costs 2 Actions)**. Baalzebul disgorges a swarm of biting flies (otherwise same as insect plague) that deals 44 (8d10) piercing damage and does not require [[concentration]].
