### Malformed Kraken
_Huge monstrosity, chaotic evil_

![[Malformed Kraken token.png]]

The Doomvault (Dead in Thay) contains a number of denizens that don't have all the traits or abilities of normal creatures of their kind. By far the most powerful of these "inferior" creatures is a malformed kraken that is kept in a saltwater pool and is not as large or as durable as a true kraken

**Amphibious**. The kraken can breathe air and water.

**Siege Monster**. The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The kraken makes three tentacle attacks. One of them can be replaced with a bite attack, and any of them can be replaced with Fling.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) piercing damage.

**Tentacle**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]]. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Fling**. One Medium or smaller object held or creature [[grappled]] by the kraken's tentacles is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked [[prone]]. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked [[prone]].

**Lightning Storm**. The kraken creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 150 feet of it. A target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
