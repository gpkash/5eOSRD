##### Actions
**Extra Attack**. The warrior can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the [[ Attack]] action on its turn.

**Longsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

#### Reactions
**Protection (Defender Only)**. The warrior imposes disadvantage on the attack roll of a creature within 5 feet of it whose target isn't the warrior. The warrior must be able to see the attacker.
