### Mind Flayer Prophet
_Medium aberration, lawful evil_

![[Mind Flayer Prophet.webp]]

Some mind flayers dedicate their lives to channeling abstruse truths from beyond reality. This insight gives them preternatural senses and allows them to focus their innate psionic power.


**Mind Flayers** Mind flayers, also known as illithids, feast on the brains of Humanoids across the multiverse. They are distinguished by their purple-toned skin and octopus-like heads, from which extend writhing tentacles.

**Awareness**. The mind flayer has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised as long as it doesn't have the [[incapacitated]] condition.

**Magic Resistance**. The mind flayer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spellcasting (Psionics).** The mind flayer casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

##### Actions
**Tentacles**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16) and must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the grapple ends.

**Extract Brain**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Humanoid [[grappled]] by the mind flayer. Hit: 55 (10d10) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills it by extracting and devouring its brain.

**Mind Whip Recharge 5-6**. The mind flayer lashes out with psychic energy, targeting up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 23 (4d8 + 5) psychic damage and have the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute. A [[stunned]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
