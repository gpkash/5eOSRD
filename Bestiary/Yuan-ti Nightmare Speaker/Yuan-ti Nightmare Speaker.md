### Yuan-ti Nightmare Speaker
_Medium monstrosity (shapechanger, yuan-ti), neutral evil_

![[Yuan-ti Nightmare Speaker.webp]]

Nightmare speakers are yuan-ti malison priests who make a pact with the Dendar the Night Serpent to feed their deity the fears and nightmares of their victims in exchange for power in the mortal world. These priests receive nightmarish visions from Dendar that they interpret as prophecies, and they then use their magic and influence to make these visions come true.

Nightmare speakers revel in torturing others, keeping their victims in a constant state of fear and dread. They prefer to terrify rather than kill their opponents. They manipulate communities for the purpose of acquiring more victims and enjoy the company of Undead.

**Shapechanger**. The yuan-ti can use its action to polymorph into a Medium snake or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. If it dies, it stays in its current form.

**Death Fangs (2/Day)**. The first time the yuan-ti hits with a melee attack on its turn, it can deal an extra 16 (3d10) necrotic damage to the target.

**Magic Resistance**. The yuan-ti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Innate Spellcasting (Yuan-ti Form Only).** The yuan-ti's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). The yuan-ti can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**Spellcasting (Yuan-ti Form Only).** The yuan-ti is a 6th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It regains its expended spell slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the following warlock spells:

Cantrips (at will): [[chill touch]], [[eldritch blast]] (range 300 ft., +3 bonus to each damage roll), [[mage hand]], [[message]], [[poison spray]], [[prestidigitation]]
3rd level (2 slots): [[arms of Hadar]], [[darkness]], [[fear]], [[hex]], [[hold person]], [[hunger of Hadar]], [[witch bolt]]

##### Actions
**Multiattack (Yuan-ti Form Only)**. The yuan-ti makes one constrict attack and one scimitar attack.

**Constrict**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the yuan-ti can't constrict another target.

**Scimitar (Yuan-ti Form Only)**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**Invoke Nightmare (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. The yuan-ti taps into the nightmares of a creature it can see within 60 feet of it and creates an illusory, immobile manifestation of the creature's deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 11 (2d10) psychic damage and is [[frightened]] of the manifestation, believing it to be real. The yuan-ti must concentrate to maintain the illusion (as if [[concentration||concentrating]] on a spell), which lasts for up to 1 minute and can't be harmed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the illusion on a success, or taking 11 (2d10) psychic damage on a failure.
