**Spellcasting.** The enchanter casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The enchanter makes three Arcane Burst attacks.

**Arcane Burst**. _Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d10 + 3) psychic damage.

#### Reactions
**Instinctive Charm Recharge 4-6**. When a visible creature within 30 feet of the enchanter makes an attack roll against it, the enchanter forces the attacker to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker redirects the attack roll to the creature closest to it, other than the enchanter or itself. If multiple eligible creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.
