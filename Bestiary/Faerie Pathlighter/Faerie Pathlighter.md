##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The faerie makes two Shining Strike attacks.

**Shining Strike**. _Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) radiant damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be wreathed in light until the end of the faerie's next turn. While a creature is wreathed in light, attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature can't benefit from the [[invisible]] condition.
