**Flyby**. The scion doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Legendary Resistance (6/Day)**. If the scion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. The scion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster**. The scion deals double damage to objects and structures.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The scion makes one attack using Cloud Morningstar or Wind Javelin, as well as two Slam attacks.

**Cloud Morningstar**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +18 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (4d10 + 10) force damage plus 22 (4d10) thunder damage.

**Wind Javelin**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +18 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 42 (5d12 + 10) thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 26 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d8 + 10) force damage.

**Thunderous Vortex Recharge 5-6**. The scion magically creates a vortex of wind in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or be pulled straight toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close as possible to the center. Then a burst of thunder erupts in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the same point. Each creature in that area takes 52 (8d12) thunder damage and must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the end of its next turn.
