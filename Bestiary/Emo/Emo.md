**Antimagic Cone**. The beholder's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the [[antimagic field]] spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholder's own eye rays.

##### Legendary Actions
The beholder can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye Ray option below. It can take only one legendary action at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The beholder regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Eye Ray**. The beholder uses one random eye ray.
