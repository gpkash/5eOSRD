### Greater Shadow Horror
_Huge aberration, neutral evil_

![[Greater Shadow Horror token.png]]

This shadowy horror was conjured by Tyreus. It is a powerful example of the terrifying evils that stalk the dark corners of Ravnica. This one is an amorphous creature of living shadow with dim reason and preternatural cunning, left here to keep trespassers from plundering the refuge without Tyreus's permission.
