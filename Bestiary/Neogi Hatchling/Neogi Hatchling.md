**Mental Fortitude**. The hatchling has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]], and magic can't put the hatchling to sleep.

**Spider Climb**. The hatchling can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

##### Actions
**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
