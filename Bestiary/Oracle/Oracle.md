### Oracle
_Medium humanoid, any alignment_

![[Oracle.jpg]]

Oracles posses the ability to interpret the patterns and language of Nyx, divining from it the flow of fates and the will of the gods. Most of these gifted—or cursed—mortals communicate with a single god, interpreting their intentions for the wider world. Others aren't aligned with a god and observe the night sky, reading Nyx like a vast, cryptic scroll for insights.

**Blessings of the Gods**. While the oracle is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier. In addition, a creature that hits the oracle with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 9 (2d8) force damage.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The oracle's spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Eldritch Touch**. _Melee Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) force damage.

#### Reactions
**Divine Insight (3/Day)**. When the oracle or a creature it can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the oracle can cause the roll to be made with advantage or disadvantage.
