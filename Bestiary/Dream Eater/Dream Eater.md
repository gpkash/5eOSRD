### Dream Eater
_Medium aberration, chaotic evil_

![[Dream Eater.webp]]

Originating from the dream-warped elven realm of Silvanesti, dream eaters are violent manifestations of nightmares and subconscious terrors. The true appearance of a dream eater is obscured, as the dream eater twists its hazy form into surreal illusions of its foes' greatest fears. However, all dream eaters share one thing: a gaping, always-smiling mouth, which it reveals before engulfing its prey in a phantasmagorical nightmare.

The key to defeating a dream eater lies not in brute force but in the ability to pierce its illusions and wrest others from its terrors. As such, bards and other persuasive adventurers find themselves uniquely poised to confront a hungering dream eater.
