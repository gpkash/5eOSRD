_Small, Medium humanoid (sorcerer), any alignment_

![[Occult Extollant.jpg]]

Occult extollants delve deep into ancient legends and seek to solve mysteries that have led other investigators to their doom, driven by an unquenchable yearning to know the unknown.


**Occultists of the Vermilion Dream** The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is viewed as an esoteric, profit-driven, but ultimately harmless cabal of ghost hunters and perpetuators of urban legends. This perception isn't inaccurate, but the consortium's leadership is obsessed with one set of legends in particular: those involving the Moon of Ill Omen, Ruidus, and the ancient figures cursed by exposure to its alien influence.

The cruelest desires and predilections of the consortium's most obsessive agents have been enhanced by contact with ruidium-tainted items.
