**Charge**. If the beast moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a maul attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 slashing damage. The DC equals your spell save DC. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked [[prone]].

**Primal Rebirth**. If the beast has died within the last hour, you can use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

**Ready Companion**. As a bonus action, you can command the beast to make its maul attack or to Hide.

##### Actions
**Maul**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d6 + 2 slashing damage.
