**Tunneler**. The aurumvorax can burrow through solid rock and metal at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 5-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The aurumvorax makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature wearing armor of any type, the aurumvorax regains 4 ([[1d6 + 1) hit points.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the aurumvorax can't use its Claw attack on another target, and when it moves, it can drag the [[grappled]] creature with it, without the aurumvorax's speed being halved.
