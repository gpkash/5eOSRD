**Arcane Leak**. When the adranach is reduced to half its hit point maximum (145 hit points), its mithral mask cracks and its arcane form begins to waver, creating a field of unstable magic around it. Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the adranach or enters that area for the first time on a turn takes 21 (6d6) radiant damage. Additionally, if a creature casts a spell within this area, it must make a DC 18 ability check using its spellcasting ability. On a failure, the spell backfires, consuming the spell slot and dealing 7 (2d6) force damage to the caster for each level of the spell slot that was consumed.

**Immutable Form**. The adranach is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance**. The adranach has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. The adranach's weapon attacks are magical.

**Colossal Build**. The adranach's carrying capacity is doubled, as is the weight it can push, drag, or lift.

**Slipstream**. The adranach can cast [[invisibility]] on itself at will. While it is [[invisible]], its speed is doubled.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If the adranach fails a saving throws, it can choose to succeed instead.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The adranach makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its tail.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, one target, reach 5 ft. Hit: 33 (4d12 + 7) slashing damage.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +14 to hit, one target, reach 15 ft. Hit: 20 (2d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Force Bolts Recharge 5-6**. The adranach targets up to six creatures it can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throws or take 35 (10d6) force damage.

##### Legendary Actions
**Claw Attack**. The adranach makes one claw attack.

**Vanish (Costs 2 Actions)**. The adranach casts [[invisibility]] and moves up to its walking or flying speed. (This movement doesn't benefit from its Slipstream trait.)

**Starry Burst (Costs 3 Actions)**. A burst of astral energy flares from the adranach's body. Each creature within 60 feet of it must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throws. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (5d10) force damage and is [[blinded]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not [[blinded]]. The adranach then turns [[invisible]] until the start of its next turn or until it makes an attack.
