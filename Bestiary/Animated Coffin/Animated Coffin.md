### Animated Coffin
_Large construct, unaligned_

![[Animated Coffin.webp]]

Animated coffins are heavy, macabre Constructs designed to ferry the dead to places of rest. They waddle the Mortuary's halls unbothered, scooping up corpses and carrying them to the next stage of the funerary process.

An animated coffin has an array of spidery metal legs it uses to skitter along steep inclines, walls, and ceilings, and the coffin's spacious interior bristles with retractable spikes. Like their inanimate counterparts, animated coffins range from plain wooden boxes with simple fittings to elaborate, gilded sarcophagi and reverent, fabric-lined caskets.

Beyond the City of Doors, animated coffins serve similar—albeit less industrial—roles. Natural ambushers and tireless sentries, animated coffins guard ancient necropolises, family crypts, and the lairs of powerful Undead. A cautious vampire might sleep in an animated coffin to evade hunters during the day, while a necromancer might enlist animated coffins to conscript corpses from faraway settlements into an Undead army.

Animated coffins are rarely empty. The Animated Coffin Contents table presents some contents an animated coffin might contain when encountered.

**False Appearance**. If the animated coffin is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the coffin move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the coffin is animate.

**Spider Climb**. The animated coffin can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The animated coffin makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
