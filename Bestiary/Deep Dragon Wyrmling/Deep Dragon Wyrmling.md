Making their lairs in the depths of the Underdark, deep dragons are nightmarish cousins of chromatic dragons. The warped magical energy of their subterranean realm gives them the ability to exhale magical spores that instill fear and scar the mind.

Deep dragons' black-and-gray hide is smooth like a salamander's, and their eyes are pale. As they age, their spore breath causes fungi to bloom across their skin, especially around the head and neck. Their wings are attached to their front legs and can fold in close to the body, allowing deep dragons to easily maneuver through relatively narrow tunnels.

Deep dragons often hoard secrets, delighting in knowledge of far-off lands. Many seek out new insights and tricks that they can use against other denizens of the Underdark, preferring social manipulation and crafty dealmaking to exerting themselves in combat. Deep dragons look down on any creature that isn't useful to them, though they are willing to bargain for knowledge they lack.

##### Actions
**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage.

**Nightmare Breath Recharge 5-6**. The dragon exhales a cloud of spores in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage, and it is [[frightened]] of the dragon for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects. A [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
