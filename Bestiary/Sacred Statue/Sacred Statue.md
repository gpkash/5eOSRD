**False Appearance**. While the statue remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue.

**Ghostly Inhabitant**. The [[eidolon|MTF]] that enters the sacred statue remains inside it until the statue drops to 0 hit points, the eidolon uses a bonus action to move out of the statue, or the eidolon is turned or forced out by an effect such as the [[dispel evil and good]] spell. When the eidolon leaves the statue, it appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the statue.

**Inert**. When not inhabited by an [[eidolon|MTF]], the statue is an object.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The statue makes two slam attacks.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 43 (6d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 37 (6d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
