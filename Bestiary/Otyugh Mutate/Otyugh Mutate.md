**Virulent Breath**. Noxious gas from the mutate's digestion of previous meals spews from its mouth. At the start of the mutate's turn, each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The mutate makes two Bite or Tentacle attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Chitin Slam.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] condition. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. On a successful save, the target is no longer [[poisoned]]. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until it no longer has the [[poisoned]] condition.

**Tentacle**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 15) and the [[restrained]] condition until this grapple ends. The mutate has two tentacles that can grapple one target each.

**Chitin Slam**. The mutate targets one creature it is grappling, slamming the creature against its chitinous plating. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage and have the [[stunned]] condition until the end of the mutate's next turn.
