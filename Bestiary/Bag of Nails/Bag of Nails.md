### Bag of Nails
_Medium humanoid (tabaxi), chaotic neutral_

![[Bag of Nails.webp]]

Bag of Nails yearns for a hunter's death. Senility has taken hold, and now he sees all creatures as his prey.

He explains that he came to Omu to find a fabled treasure called the Navel of the Moon. He hoped to use its alleged powers to find his lost son, but he has long since given up hope of ever finding it.
