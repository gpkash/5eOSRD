### Decapus
_Large monstrosity, unaligned_

![[Decapus.jpg]]

Decapuses are carnivorous, solitary hunters that swing through trees, scooping up prey with their 10-foot-long, suckered tentacles. Decapuses also use their tentacles to climb walls and ceilings.

After securing a high vantage point, a decapus hangs by one tentacle and attacks with the other nine. On the ground, a decapus is slower and less dangerous. It must use half of its tentacles to support its weight upright, leaving five tentacles with which it can attack and defend itself.

**Marine Decapus** A marine decapus is similar to its land-dwelling cousin, except that it gains a swimming speed of 30 feet and can breathe only underwater.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The decapus makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tentacles.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature [[grappled]] by the decapus. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage.

**Tentacles**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (9d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage or 14 (5d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage if the decapus is grappling a creature other than the target or if the decapus is on the ground or floor. The target is also [[grappled]] (escape DC 14) unless the decapus is already grappling a creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]].
