**Spellcasting.** The stoneguard is a 3rd-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following druid spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): [[druidcraft]], [[resistance]]
1st level (4 slots): [[goodberry]], [[speak with animals]], [[thunderwave]]
2nd level (2 slots): [[hold person]], [[spike growth]]

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The stoneguard makes three granite maul attacks.

**Granite Maul**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the attack hits, the stoneguard can also immediately cast [[thunderwave]] as a bonus action. This casting uses a spell slot but requires no components.

#### Reactions
**Sentinel**. When a creature within 5 feet of the stoneguard attacks a target other than the stoneguard, the stoneguard can make one attack against that creature.
