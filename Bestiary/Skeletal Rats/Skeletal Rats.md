**Keen Smell**. The swarm has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Swarm**. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny rat. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

##### Actions
**Bites**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 7 (2d6) piercing damage, or 3 (1d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
