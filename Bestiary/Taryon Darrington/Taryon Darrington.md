**Alchemical Defense**. Tary's experimental concoctions have granted him resistance to acid and poison damage, and immunity to the [[poisoned]] condition.

**Doty**. [[Doty X|Doty]] moves and acts on Tary's turn, and Tary can use a bonus action to command him to use the [[ Dash]], [[ Dodge]], [[ Disengage]], or [[ Attack]] action. He can also command him to [[ Attack]] as part of his Multitask action (see below). Doty can take only one action on each of Tary's turns.

**Focused**. Tary has advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain [[concentration]] on spells.

**Special Equipment**. Tary wears a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic Items (old)/Helm of Brilliance]], a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic Items (old)/Robe of Useful Items]], and a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Ring of the Ram/Ring of the Ram]]. He carries a [[Rod of Mercurial Form]], as well as a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Bag of Holding/Bag of Holding]], [[1d4 + 4 [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Bead of Force/Bead of Force||beads of force]], a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Broom of Flying/Broom of Flying]], and a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Chime of Opening/Chime of Opening]].

**Toughness**. Tary has an additional 30 hit points.

**Spellcasting.** Tary is a 15th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): [[mending]], [[prestidigitation]], [[ray of frost]] (3d8)
1st level (4 slots): [[detect magic]], [[heroism]], [[identify]], [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Mundane Items/Shield/Shield|Shield]]
2nd level (3 slots): [[alter self]], [[branding smite]], [[see invisibility]], [[warding bond]]
3rd level (3 slots): [[dispel magic]], [[fly]], [[haste]], [[magic circle]], [[revivify]]
4th level (2 slots): [[banishment]], [[fabricate]], [[fire shield]]

##### Actions
**Multitask**. Tary makes two weapon attacks or casts a spell with a casting time of 1 action, and can also command [[Doty X|Doty]] to use his Empowered Fist or Repair action.

**Mercurial Longsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage.

**[[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Bead of Force/Bead of Force]]**. Tary throws a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Bead of Force/Bead of Force]] up to 60 feet. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throws or take 12 (5d4) force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside the sphere.

#### Reactions
**Brilliant Intellect**. When Tary or another creature he can see within 30 feet of him makes an ability check or a saving throws, he can use his reaction to add +4 to the roll.
