### Kraghammer Goat-Knight
_Medium humanoid (dwarf), _

![[GoatKnightFluff.jpg]]

The sheer cliff faces and winding mountainside roads of the [[Cliffkeep Mountains|3|Cliffkeep Mountains]] are nearly impossible to traverse by normal means with any speed. The Peakclimber Knights of [[Kraghammer|3|Kraghammer]]—commonly known as the [[Kraghammer Goat-Knight|goat-knights]]—are the enforcers of peace and justice across the mountain range. They trust their [[Goat-Knight Steed|giant goat steeds]] to master the harsh mountain slopes, and many travelers lost within the [[Cliffkeep Mountains|3|Cliffkeep Mountains]] have been saved by a [[Kraghammer Goat-Knight|goat-knight]] who led them to safety along the more traversable mountain paths.

These knights serve the [[ The All-Hammer|Exandria|All-Hammer]] and sometimes find themselves at odds while enforcing the laws of [[Kraghammer|3|Kraghammer]] and upholding the edicts of their god.

**Mounted Combatant** Any spell the [[Kraghammer Goat-Knight|goat-knight]] casts with a range of self also targets the goat.

When a [[Goat-Knight Steed]] drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. The [[Kraghammer Goat-Knight|goat-knight]] can also dismiss the steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In either case, the same steed is summoned when the [[Kraghammer Goat-Knight|goat-knight]] casts [[find steed]].
