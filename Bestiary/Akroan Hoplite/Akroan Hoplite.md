**Hold the Line**. While the hoplite is holding a spear, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from the hoplite when they move within 5 feet of it. When the hoplite hits a creature with an opportunity attack using its spear, the creature takes an extra 4 (1d8) piercing damage, and the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The hoplite makes three melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

**Spear**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Shield Bash**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].
