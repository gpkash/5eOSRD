**Enchanting Presence**. Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[charmed]] by the eladrin for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Enchanting Presence for 24 hours. Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the [[charmed]] creature, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Fey Step Recharge 4-6**. As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Magic Resistance**. The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The eladrin's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Longsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage plus 18 (4d8) psychic damage, or 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage plus 18 (4d8) psychic damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) psychic damage.

#### Reactions
**Foster Peace**. If a creature [[charmed]] by the eladrin hits with an attack roll while within 60 feet of the eladrin, the eladrin magically causes the attack to miss, provided the eladrin can see the attacker.
