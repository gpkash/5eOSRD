**Flyby**. The dragon doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Unusual Nature**. The dragon doesn't require air.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The dragon makes one Bite attack and one Tail attack.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) radiant damage.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Photonic Breath Recharge 5-6**. The dragon exhales a flashing mote of radiant energy that travels to a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of itself, then blossoms into a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
