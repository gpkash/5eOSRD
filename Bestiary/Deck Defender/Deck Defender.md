**Allied Knight**. Some of the deck defender's statistics are based on the character who drew the Knight card. Where the deck defender stat block refers to "you," it refers to that character.

**Folded Versatility**. After finishing a long rest, you can refold the deck defender's shape, changing it to acrobat form, berserker form, or guardian form.

**Fragile**. If the deck defender is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses into a haphazard pile of nonmagical playing cards and can't be resurrected or reconstructed.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The deck defender makes a number of attacks equal to half its proficiency bonus (rounded down).

**Paper Cut**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ PB + +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

**Reckless Strike (Berserker Form Only)**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ PB + +3 to hit (with advantage), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage, and attacks made against the deck defender until the start of its next turn have advantage.

#### Reactions
**Protection (Guardian Form Only)**. When a creature the deck defender can see attacks a target other than the deck defender and is within 5 feet of the deck defender, the deck defender imposes disadvantage on the attack roll.
