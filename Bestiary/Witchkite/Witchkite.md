### Witchkite
_Huge dragon (warlock), chaotic evil_

![[Witchkite.jpg]]

While many dragons of Eldraine hoard wealth and material goods, witchkites prefer hoarding forbidden and dangerous magical secrets. The arcane nature of a witchkite's hoard seeps into the dragon's core, granting it spellcasting abilities and twisting its fiery breath into malevolent motes of magical flame.
