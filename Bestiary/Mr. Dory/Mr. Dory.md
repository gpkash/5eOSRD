### Mr. Dory
_Medium aberration, chaotic evil_

![[Mr. Dory.webp]]

One of the four councillors who rule the Styes, Mr. Dory hides his cursed nature in plain sight. His rare, liquid-sensitive "skin condition" is actually a form of the same aboleth affliction that creates skum, though Dory's condition is not as severe, and he has managed to retain his free will.
