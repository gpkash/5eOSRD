### Zariel
_Large fiend (devil), lawful evil_

![[Zariel token.png]]

Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, Zariel succumbed to the corrupting influence of the Nine Hells and fell from grace. Asmodeus admired Zariel's passion for war and offered her rulership of Avernus. She accepted his offer and was transformed by Asmodeus into an archdevil.

Zariel's rise came at the expense of Bel, her pit fiend predecessor. Zariel and Bel hate each other. To keep Bel busy and out of her sight, Zariel tasks him with forging weapons, armor, and gruesome demon-slaying machines.

**Zariel's Lair** Zariel makes her lair in a basalt citadel that rises up in Avernus. The stronghold, covering five square miles, is surrounded by walls reinforced with high turrets.

**Devil's Sight**. Magical darkness doesn't impede Zariel's darkvision.

**Magic Weapons**. Zariel's weapon attacks are magical. When she hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 36 (8d8) fire damage (included in the weapon attacks below).

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Zariel fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. Zariel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration**. Zariel regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn. If she takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn. Zariel dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Innate Spellcasting.** Zariel's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 26). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Zariel attacks twice with her longsword or with her javelins. She can substitute Horrid Touch for one of these attacks.

**Longsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) slashing damage plus 36 (8d8) fire damage, or 19 (2d10 + 8) slashing damage plus 36 (8d8) fire damage if used with two hands.

**Horrid Touch Recharge 5-6**. Zariel touches one creature within 10 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Constitution saving throw or take 44 (8d10) necrotic damage and be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the target is also [[blinded]] and [[deafened]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Teleport**. Zariel magically teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.

##### Legendary Actions
