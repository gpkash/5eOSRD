##### Actions
**Sting**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]] in this way.
