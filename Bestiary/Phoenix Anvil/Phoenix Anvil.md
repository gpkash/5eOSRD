### Phoenix Anvil
_Medium humanoid (human), lawful neutral_

![[The B Team.webp]]

The "B" Team hoards person, Phoenix Anvil is a servant of Waukeen and a soft-spoken sort. Really soft. Like, he talks so infrequently that even he might not recognize his own voice. Phoenix comes from the streets, where he grew up a fighter until a job sweeping the steps of a small temple of Waukeen showed him a new path. His hunger for coin as an adventurer is thus guided by his knowledge of what it is to do without.

More of an object individual than a people person, Phoenix is obsessively dedicated to the franchise's assets and accounts. Thankfully, he includes his fellow members among those assets, making him fiercely loyal. However, Oak Truestrike is the only team member he's ever really warmed to, which doesn't do either of them any good.
