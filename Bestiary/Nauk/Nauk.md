### Nauk
_Medium humanoid (half-orc), lawful evil_

![[Nauk.jpg]]

Nauk is a half-orc warrior and senior member of the Flaming Fist in Baldur's Gate. He is also one of Faerûn's most notorious arms dealers. Nauk feeds the flames of civil strife in other nations, usually by providing assassins, mercenaries or magic. When outright war breaks out, the Flaming Fist is ready to offer their services for a hefty profit.

Nauk is one of the most well-connected members of the Flaming Fist. He has contacts and friends in almost every nation and city state in western Faerûn. Some of these come from his younger years as an adventurer, while others have been made through his arms deals.

Nauk is not above getting his hands dirty and has earned his nickname—the Bag Man. Sometimes his customers renege on a deal or are unable to pay for the services that he has provided. When this happens, Nauk enjoys making an object lesson out of the poor fool. Depending on who needs to be punished, Nauk either shows up with a small band of the Flaming Fist's hardest veterans or with a small army. No matter who he arrives with, Nauk always takes the lead.

Nauk dresses in full battle gear, even when just sitting down for a discussion with a possible client. This is because what he wears and wields are examples of what he can provide to a potential customer. This includes adamantine plate armor, multiple enchanted weapons and a dozen potions and other minor magic items. If he needs to convince a client of the effectiveness of what he has to sell, he will offer to fight the best warrior they can send at him.

**Nauk as a Contact** Nauk is the primary contact for members of the Flaming Fist at low levels. Magic items can be purchased from Nauk. He specializes in selling potions.
