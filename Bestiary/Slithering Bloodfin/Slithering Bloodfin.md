### Slithering Bloodfin
_Large aberration, unaligned_

![[Slithering Bloodfin.jpg]]

Covered in vicious-looking crimson spines and sleek scales, the slithering bloodfin flashes through the lightless waters of the Netherdeep. As it swims closer, its toothed maw comes into viewâ€”just before it unhinges its jaw, clamps down on its prey, and swallows it whole.

A slithering bloodfin looks like a giant eel with a head like a shark's. It magically siphons life energy from swallowed prey and uses that energy to repair damage to its own body.

When a bloodfin dies, its body bursts. The resulting gore is toxic, threatening to infect nearby creatures, until it is dissipated by currents.

**Death Burst**. When the bloodfin dies, it explodes in a cloud of toxic blood. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the exploding bloodfin, including any creature swallowed by the bloodfin, must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage. A creature inside the bloodfin when it explodes falls [[prone]] in the space formerly occupied by the bloodfin and is no longer [[blinded]] or [[restrained]] by it.

**Water Breathing**. The bloodfin can breathe only underwater.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The bloodfin makes one Bite attack and one Tail attack.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit (with advantage if the target is a creature missing any hit points), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the bloodfin can't bite another target.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit (with advantage if the target is a creature missing any hit points), reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
