**Sculpt Spells**. When the evoker casts an evocation spell that forces other creatures it can see to make a saving throw, it can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. These creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell. If a successful save means a chosen creature would take half damage from the spell, it instead takes no damage from it.

**Spellcasting.** The evoker is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The evoker has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): [[fire bolt]]*, [[5eOSRD/Spellcasting/Spells/Light/Light|Light]]*, [[prestidigitation]], [[ray of frost]]*
1st level (4 slots): [[burning hands]]*, [[mage armor]], [[magic missile]]*
2nd level (3 slots): [[mirror image]], [[misty step]], [[shatter]]*
3rd level (3 slots): [[counterspell]], [[fireball]]*, [[lightning bolt]]*
4th level (3 slots): [[ice storm]]*, [[stoneskin]]
