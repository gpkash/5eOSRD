**False Appearance**. If the rocking horse is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the rocking horse move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the rocking horse is animate.

**Flying Mount**. The rocking horse can serve as a mount for a Medium or smaller creature and can fly only while mounted.

**Unusual Nature**. The rocking horse doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep, and it regains no hit points or Hit Dice at the end of a long rest.

##### Actions
**Head Butt**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.
