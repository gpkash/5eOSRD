### Living Unseen Servant
_Medium construct, unaligned_

![[Living Unseen Servant token.png]]

**Living Spell** Areas of wild magic and sites that have been ravaged by powerful eldritch forces can give rise to spell effects that refuse to dissipate. These so-called living spells haunt the places where they were created, subsisting on ambient magical energy.

A living spell appears much like a normal spell effect, except that its magical energy lingers and moves with purpose.

**Constructed Nature** A living spell doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


**Magical Essence** The process that creates a living spell changes the nature of its magic. A living spell isn't subject to [[dispel magic]] and isn't affected by an [[antimagic field]].



Like an overzealous butler or maid, a living [[unseen servant]] spell busies itself with tasks in hopes of pleasing its creator. It can wield simple weapons but prefers not to. [[See invisibility]], [[true seeing]], and similar effects reveal that the servant has a shape similar to that of a slender humanoid adult.
