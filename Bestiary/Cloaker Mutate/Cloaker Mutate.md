**Avoidance**. If the mutate is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

**Light Sensitivity**. While in bright light, the mutate has disadvantage on attack rolls.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The mutate makes one Corpse Swipe attack and two Tail attacks, or it makes four Tail attacks.

**Corpse Swipe**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] condition for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] in this way, a creature can't regain hit points.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
