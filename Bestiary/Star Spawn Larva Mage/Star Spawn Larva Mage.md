**Return to Worms**. When the larva mage is reduced to 0 hit points, it breaks apart into a [[swarm of insects]] in the same space. Unless the swarm is destroyed, the larva mage reforms from it 24 hours later.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The larva mage's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

*3 beams, +3 bonus to each damage roll

##### Actions
**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the end of its next turn.

**Plague of Worms Recharge 6**. Each creature other than a star spawn within 10 feet of the larva mage must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure the target takes 22 (5d8) necrotic damage and is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]] by masses of swarming worms. The affected creature takes 22 (5d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of the larva mage's turns. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

##### Legendary Actions
**Cantrip (Costs 2 Actions)**. The larva mage casts one cantrip.

**Slam (Costs 2 Actions)**. The larva mage makes one slam attack.

**Feed (Costs 3 Actions)**. Each creature [[restrained]] by the larva mage's Plague of Worms takes 13 (3d8) necrotic damage, and the larva mage gains 6 temporary hit points.
