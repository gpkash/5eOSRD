### Swavain Basilisk
_Huge monstrosity, unaligned_

![[Swavain Basilisk.webp]]

Pearl divers and seafloor scavengers sometimes tell tales of mysterious ocean gardens filled with statues of sea creatures and sailorsâ€”the underwater grottoes of the deadly Swavain basilisk. Though named for the Swavain Islands where they are most commonly found, these dangerous hunters have been known to wander inland waterways, and have even been spotted in subterranean sewer systems.

**Amphibious**. The basilisk can breathe air and water.

**Petrifying Secretions**. A creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if it hits the basilisk with a weapon attack while within 5 feet of it or if it starts its turn [[grappled]] by the basilisk. Unless the save succeeds, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is [[restrained]], and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [[petrified]].
