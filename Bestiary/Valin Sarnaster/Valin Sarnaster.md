### Valin Sarnaster
_Medium undead, lawful evil_

![[Valin Sarnaster.jpg]]

Valin Sarnaster has been thoroughly corrupted by visions of a future in which she sees herself as the immortal heir of Savras's realm.[[The Canopic Being]]came into her possession years ago, and an obsession with the dark rituals therein set the oracle on her present course.

Valin has become a powerful undead as the first step on her path to godhood, and is now a mummy lord.

Valin can use her lair actions in any area of the tomb.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Valin can use her Dreadful Glare and makes one attack with her rotting fist.

**Rotting Fist**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the [[remove curse]] spell or other magic.

**Dreadful Glare**. Valin targets one creature she can see within 60 feet of her. If the target can see Valin, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become [[frightened]] until the end of Valin's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also [[paralyzed]] for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and mummy lords for the next 24 hours.

##### Legendary Actions

**Blasphemous Word (Costs 2 Actions)**. Valin utters a blasphemous word. Each non-undead creature within 10 feet of Valin that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of Valin's next turn.
