**Mental Burst**. When the goblin dies, its pent-up mental energy explodes in a psychic blast. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or take 10 (4d4) psychic damage.

**Mental Fortitude**. The goblin has advantage on saving throws against effects that would make it have the [[charmed]] or [[frightened]] conditions.

**Spellcasting (Psionics).** The goblin casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The goblin makes three Psychic Blade attacks.

**Psychic Blade**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) psychic damage, and the target must subtract 1d4 from the next attack roll or saving throw it makes before the end of the goblin's next turn.

**Synaptic Rend Recharge 5-6**. The goblin unleashes a 30-foot-radius sphere of psychic energy, centered on a point the goblin can see within 60 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage and has the [[incapacitated]] condition until the end of the goblin's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

#### Reactions
**Nimble Escape**. The goblin takes the Disengage or Hide action.

**Psionic Shield**. When the goblin or one of its allies within 15 feet of it is hit by an attack roll, the goblin conjures a shield of force. The target of the attack gains a +3 bonus to its AC against the triggering attack roll, potentially causing it to miss.
