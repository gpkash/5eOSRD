Martial arts adepts are disciplined monks with extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. Some protect monasteries; others travel the world seeking enlightenment or new forms of combat to master. A few become bodyguards, trading their combat prowess and loyalty for food and lodging.

Some martial artists adorn themselves with tattoos to honor inspirations or instructors, or to memorialize profound lessons, triumphs, or defeats. You may roll on the Martial Arts Adept Tattoos table to determine what sort of tattoo an adept bears.

If the damage is reduced to 0, the adept catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and the adept has a hand free.
