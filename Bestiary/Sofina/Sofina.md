### Sofina
_Medium humanoid (wizard), neutral evil_

![[Sofina.jpg]]

Sofina is a Red Wizard of Thay, an elite practitioner of magic with ties to Thay's tyrannical magocracy. Sofina specializes in necromancy. Death magic and fear are both tools in her arsenal.

As Red Wizards are shunned outside Thay, Sofina conceals her affiliations and coldly rebuffs any who seek her friendship. A canny operator, she has patiently moved her pieces into place, and her grand designs now begin to take shape.

These spheres can overlap. Each creature in one or more of these spheres must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage and 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in multiple spheres takes this damage only once.
