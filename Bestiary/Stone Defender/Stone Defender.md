**False Appearance**. While the stone defender remains motionless against an uneven earthen or stone surface, it is indistinguishable from that surface.

**Magic Resistance**. The stone defender has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, it is knocked [[prone]].

#### Reactions
**Intercept Attack**. In response to another creature within 5 feet of it being hit by an attack roll, the stone defender gives that creature a +5 bonus to its AC against that attack, potentially causing a miss. To use this ability, the stone defender must be able to see the creature and the attacker.
