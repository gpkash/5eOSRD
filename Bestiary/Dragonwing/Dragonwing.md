**Dragon Fanatic**. The dragonwing has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]]. While the dragonwing can see a dragon or higher-ranking Cult of the Dragon cultist friendly to it, the dragonwing ignores the effects of being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]].

**Fanatic Advantage**. Once per turn, if the dragonwing makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage.

**Limited Flight**. The dragonwing can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of its turn.

**Pack Tactics**. The dragonwing has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dragonwing's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The dragonwing attacks twice with its scimitar.

**Scimitar**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) damage of the type to which the cultist has resistance.
