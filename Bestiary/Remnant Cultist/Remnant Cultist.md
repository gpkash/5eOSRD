**Unknowable Secrets**. Any attempt to form a mental link with the cultist, cast [[scrying]] on the cultist, or cast [[speak with dead]] on the cultist automatically fails, and the creature that initiated the attempt takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage.

**One-Eyed**. The cultist has disadvantage on any attack roll made against a target more than 30 feet away.

**Spellsteal**. If the cultist successfully uses [[counterspell]] to negate another creature's spell, it can cast the countered spell once before the end of its next turn using one of its spell slots of the same level or higher, and requiring no material components.

**Spellcasting.** The remnant cultist is an 11th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The cultist has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): [[chill touch]] (3d8), [[message]], [[minor illusion]], [[prestidigitation]], [[ray of frost]] (3d8)
1st level (4 slots): [[detect magic]], [[Tasha's hideous laughter]], [[mage armor]], [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Mundane Items/Shield/Shield|Shield]]
2nd level (3 slots): [[detect thoughts]], [[suggestion]]
3rd level (3 slots): [[counterspell]], [[fear]], [[vampiric touch]]
4th level (3 slots): [[greater invisibility]], [[phantasmal killer]]
5th level (2 slots): [[dream]], [[mislead]]
6th level (1 slots): [[circle of death]]

##### Actions
**Dagger of Wounding**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. Hit points lost to [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic Items (old)/Sword of Wounding|DMG|this weapon's]] damage can be regained only through a [[Short Rest]] or [[Long Rest]], rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means. Once per turn when the cultist hits a creature with an attack using this weapon, it can wound its target. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for each time it's been wounded by this weapon. It can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throws, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Medicine]]) check, ending the effect of such wounds on it on a success.
