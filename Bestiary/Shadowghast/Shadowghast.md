### Shadowghast
_Medium undead, chaotic evil_

![[Shadowghast.webp]]

A shadowghast is an undead assassin. Leaping out from the shadows and trailing tendrils of darkness, it closes in on its prey with nary a sound, then tears into a victim with its paralyzing claws and furious bite.

**Stench**. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the shadowghast must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to this Stench for 24 hours.

**Shadow Stealth**. While in dim light or darkness, the shadowghast can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The shadowghast makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) slashing damage plus 5 (1d10) necrotic damage.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
