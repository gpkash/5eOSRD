**Magic Resistance**. The chosen has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Withering Spells**. When the chosen casts a spell of 1st level or higher, the next Withered Hand attack it makes before the end of its next turn deals extra damage equal to 1d6 per level of the spell cast.

Cantrips (at will): [[chill touch]] (4d8), [[dancing lights]], [[mage hand]], [[message]], [[shocking grasp]] (4d8)
1st level (4 slots): [[charm person]], [[mage armor]], [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Mundane Items/Shield/Shield|Shield]]

##### Actions
**Withering Touch**. _Melee Spell Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (5d6) force damage plus extra damage from the Withering Touch trait. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a [[true resurrection]] or a [[wish]] spell.
