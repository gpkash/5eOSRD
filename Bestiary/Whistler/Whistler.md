### Whistler
_Large aberration, neutral evil_

![[Whistler.jpg]]

Whistlers are inscrutable stalkers hailing from airy, screeching reaches of the Far Realm. They are difficult to see as they're not tethered to one point in space, blurring in a state of perpetual physical uncertainty. A dead whistler appears as a gray, featureless, humanlike biped with long limbs and thin fingers. Those stalked by a whistler can't shut out its soundless, seven-note tune, an otherworldly melody that invades and scourges the mind. Few creatures that encounter a whistler escape; those that do are forever haunted by the stalker's frightful tune.

**Otherworldly Melody Recharge 5-6**. The whistler telepathically whistles an otherworldly melody into the minds of up to two creatures it can see within range of its telepathy.
