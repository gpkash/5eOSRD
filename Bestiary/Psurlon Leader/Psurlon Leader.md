One out of every hundred psurlons is a mutant with two heads, one at each end of its body, and a superior intellect. Other psurlons look to the two-headed ones for leadership.

**Aberrant Mind**. Magic can't read the psurlon's thoughts or put the psurlon to sleep.

**Two Heads**. The psurlon has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid or end the [[frightened]], [[stunned]], or [[unconscious]] condition on itself. While one of the psurlon's heads is asleep, its other head is awake.

**Spellcasting (Psionics).** The psurlon casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The psurlon makes two Bite attacks and two Claw attacks. It can also use Pacify (if available) or Psychic Crush.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage.

**Pacify Recharge 5-6**. The psurlon targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall [[unconscious]] for 10 minutes. The condition ends if the target takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the target awake.

**Psychic Crush**. The psurlon targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 21 (3d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
