### Flesh Colossus
_Gargantuan construct, unaligned_

![[Flesh Colossus.jpg]]

During the dawn of the giants' empires, twisted minds sought to make their fallen comrades continue their service. Wizard giants stitched and wove the flesh of various giants over an adamantine skeleton, creating a grisly colossal construct. Inside the flesh colossus's chest is a stone sphere infused with spirits from each elemental plane acting as its core.

To this day, some of these ancient flesh colossi guard abandoned ruins, sites sacred to giants, and lost treasuresâ€”and possibly the procedure to create new examples of their kind.

**Berserk**. If the core inside the colossus is destroyed, the colossus goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the colossus attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the colossus attacks an object. Once the colossus goes berserk, it remains berserk until it is destroyed.

**Immutable Form**. The colossus is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance**. The colossus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster**. The colossus deals double damage to objects and structures.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The colossus makes two Fist attacks.

**Fist**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit (with advantage if the colossus is berserk), reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is pulled up to 15 feet toward the colossus, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 17), and it has the [[restrained]] condition until this grapple ends. The colossus can have up to two creatures [[grappled]] this way at a time.

**Elemental Breath Recharge 5-6**. The colossus exhales a cloud swirling with elemental energy in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 40 (9d8) damage of a type of the colossus's choosing: acid, cold, fire, or lightning. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. At the same time as the colossus releases this exhalation, creatures inside the colossus's chest cavity take 40 (9d8) force damage from churning elemental energy.
