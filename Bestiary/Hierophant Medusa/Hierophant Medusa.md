### Hierophant Medusa
_Large monstrosity, any alignment_

![[Hierophant Medusa.jpg]]

Sometimes deeply devout people, usually either Humanoids or medusas, dedicate themselves to a cause and are transformed by a deity or magic into hierophant medusas—beings with powerful snakelike tails for their lower body, snakes for hair, and a petrifying gaze. The first hierophant medusa was transformed by the power of the Euryale card when that individual was inspired by Euryale's story and unwavering conviction.

These medusas are divinely empowered champions, drawing their power from a cosmic truth, the will of a deity, or the primal forces of nature. They gather and inspire followers, protecting their people and guiding them to fulfill the medusa's divine purpose. The Divine Purpose table offers suggestions for motivations. Roll on the table, or use the entries as inspiration to create your own.




**A Medusa's Lair** A medusa's lair is often decorated with the petrified bodies of creatures that raised arms against the medusa or its followers. The lair is typically a rich repository of knowledge, with lore both worldly and esoteric filling books, scrolls, tablets, or stranger archives—such as magical crystals that hold captured memories or the voices of those long dead. You can use this lair and the lair actions described for any medusa, including the hierophant medusa or the medusa in the Monster Manual.

**Devotion's Call (1/Day)**. The medusa can cast the [[Resurrection]] spell, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day)**. If the medusa fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Spellcasting.** The medusa casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 20):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The medusa makes one Constrict attack, one Final Blade attack, and one Snake Hair attack. Alternatively, it makes two Wrathful Strike attacks.

**Constrict**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target has the [[restrained]] condition, and the medusa can't constrict another creature.

**Final Blade**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) force damage. If the target has at least one head and the medusa rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it fails a DC 20 Constitution saving throw and can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra 28 (8d6) force damage from the hit.

**Snake Hair**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) poison damage.

**Wrathful Strike**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) radiant damage, and the target has the [[blinded]] condition until the end of its next turn.

##### Legendary Actions
**Move**. The medusa moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Wrathful Blast (Costs 2 Actions)**. The medusa makes one Wrathful Strike attack.

**Final Slash (Costs 3 Actions)**. The medusa makes one Final Blade attack with advantage.
