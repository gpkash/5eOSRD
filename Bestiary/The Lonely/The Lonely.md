### The Lonely
_Medium monstrosity, lawful evil_

![[The Lonely.webp]]

**The Lonely** The sorrow of isolation afflicts many creatures that lurk in the Shadowfell, but the need for companionship is never manifested more dramatically than in the Lonely. When these sorrowsworn spot other creatures, they feel keenly the need for interaction and so they launch their harpoon-like arms to drag their victims close.

**Sorrowsworn** The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. The sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering that are inherent to the shadowy landscape, and they visit horror on those who stumble into their midst.

**Emotion Given Form** Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress. Some are manifestations of anger; others are loneliness given physical form. Their nature provides a clue both to understanding how they become more powerful and to overcoming them. Giving in to the negative emotions that the sorrowsworn represent causes these entities to grow deadlier. Fighting against these emotions can weaken them and drive them away.

##### Lore

History DC 15: Connection and understanding are in short supply in the domains of shadow, and none feel the sting of that more accutely than the lonely, some who are transformed even in the midst of thriving settlements.

History DC 20: The lonely appear to experience intense pain whenever creatures flee their presence, their wretchedness often giving deadly pause to even the most hard-hearted of shadow delvers.

Nature DC 15: While the extensible arms of the lonely can be damaged and destroyed, the creature seems able to produce replacements without effort or distress.

##### Tactics

The lonely runs headlong into the greatest concentration of enemies and attempts to grapple two of them, switching to its Sorrowful Embrace once it has a creature grappled with each arm. If enemies try to destroy its arms, it changes tactics, instead using its Branching Barbs whenever it is available and the lonely has two creatures grappled.

If a single foe tries to leave its reach, the lonely usually will make an opportunity attack to grapple it and keep it from doing so, but if multiple creatures seem to be triggering its abandonment weakness it instead uses its Wretched Sobbing to keep them from fleeing.

**Psychic Leech**. At the start of each of the Lonely's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (3d6) psychic damage.

**Thrives on Company**. The Lonely has advantage on attack rolls while it is within 30 feet of at least two other creatures. It otherwise has disadvantage on attack rolls.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The Lonely makes one harpoon arm attack and uses Sorrowful Embrace.

**Harpoon Arm**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (4d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15) if it is a Large or smaller creature. The Lonely has two harpoon arms and can grapple up to two creatures at once.

**Sorrowful Embrace**. Each creature [[grappled]] by the Lonely must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. A creature takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the Lonely pulls each creature [[grappled]] by it up to 30 feet straight toward it.
