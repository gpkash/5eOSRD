##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The thri-kreen makes two Gythka attacks and one Chatkcha attack.

**Gythka**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit (with advantage if the thri-kreen is missing any hit points), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**Chatkcha**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit (with advantage if the thri-kreen is missing any hit points), range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.

#### Reactions
**Parry**. The thri-kreen adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the thri-kreen must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
