### Adult Time Dragon
_Huge dragon, neutral_

![[Adult Time Dragon.webp]]

These sleek dragons harness the power of time to manipulate the past, present, and future. Time dragon wyrmlings are born with shining scales and have horns that are barely more than nubs. As they master the flow of time, their horns grow with branching, rainbow-hued veins suggestive of time's paths and possibilities. Ancient time dragons can create temporal gates connected to specific times and places in the multiverse. Using these, they and allied creatures can travel anywhere in time to affect fate-determining moments or to banish threats beyond the flow of time. As a result of their ability to travel between ages, time dragons often seem unstuck from the usual flow of time and have a flexible view of what is, what was, and what will be.

Time dragons prize historical records, objects representative of lost cultures, and treasures from long-gone creators. They are fascinated by time-manipulation magic and forgotten knowledge. Those who stumble upon a time dragon's hoard might find invaluable historical information from eras past.


**A Time Dragon's Lair** Time dragons often lair in the ruins of ancient civilizations or temples to dead gods and do their utmost to preserve these historical sites. A time dragon's insatiable desire for knowledge means it's likely to have more than one such lair.

The challenge rating of an ancient or adult time dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The dragon makes three Rend attacks.

**Rend**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) force damage.

**Time Breath Recharge 5-6**. The dragon exhales a wave of shimmering light in a 60-foot cone. Nonmagical objects and vegetation in that area that aren't being worn or carried crumble to dust. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8) force damage and is magically weakened as it is desynchronized from the time stream. While the creature is in this state, attack rolls against it have advantage, and it has the [[poisoned]] condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A weakened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself after it succeeds on three of these saves.

#### Reactions
**Reactive Rend**. After using Legendary Resistance or in response to being hit by an attack roll, the dragon makes one Rend attack.

**Slow Time**. Immediately after a creature the dragon can see ends its turn, the dragon targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself that is weakened by its Time Breath. Until the weakened effect ends on the target, its speed becomes 0, and its speed can't increase.

**Time Slip**. The dragon halves the damage it takes from an attack made against it, provided it can see the attacker. The dragon can then immediately teleport, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
