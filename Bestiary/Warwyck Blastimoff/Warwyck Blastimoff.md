**Firearms Knowledge**. The giff's mastery of its weapons enables it to ignore the loading property of any firearm.

**Steady as She Goes**. On the deck of a ship, the giff has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made against effects that would knock it [[prone]] or shove it overboard.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The giff makes two Longsword or Musket attacks.

**Longsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Musket**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d12 + 2) piercing damage.

**Force Grenade**. The giff throws a grenade up to 60 feet, and the grenade explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the giff throws the grenade, roll a d6; on a roll of 4 or lower, the giff has no more grenades to throw.
