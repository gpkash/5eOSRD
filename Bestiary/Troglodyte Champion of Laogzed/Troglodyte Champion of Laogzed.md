### Troglodyte Champion of Laogzed
_Medium humanoid (troglodyte), chaotic evil_

![[Troglodyte Champion of Laogzed token.png]]

The Monster Manual provides statistics for the typical troglodyte. Once in a while, a troglodyte tribe produces an unusually smart and strong specimen that can spew acid-what many troglodytes consider blessings from Laogzed, their demonic god. These hulking troglodyte champions make excellent chieftains.

**Chameleon Skin**. The troglodyte has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.

**Stench**. Any creature other than a troglodyte that starts its turn within 5 feet of the troglodyte must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all troglodytes for 1 hour.

**Sunlight Sensitivity**. While in sunlight, the troglodyte has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The troglodyte makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with either its claws or its greatclub.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage.

**Greatclub**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Acid Spray Recharge 6**. The troglodyte spits acid in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
