### Orcus
_Huge fiend (demon), chaotic evil_

![[Orcus.jpg]]

Orcus is the Demon Prince of Undeath, also known as the Blood Lord. While he takes pleasure in the sufferings of the living, he far prefers the company and service of Undead. His desire is to see all life quenched and the multiverse transformed into a vast necropolis populated solely by Undead creatures under his command.

Orcus rewards those who spread death in his name by granting them a small portion of his power. The least of these become [[ghoul||ghouls]] and [[zombie||zombies]] that serve in his legions, while his favored servants are the cultists and necromancers who murder the living and then manipulate the dead, emulating their dread master.

Orcus is a bestial creature of corruption with a diseased, decaying look. He has the lower torso of a goat and a humanlike upper body with a belly swollen with rot. Great bat wings sprout from his shoulders, and his head is like the skull of a goat, the flesh nearly rotted from it. In one hand, he wields the legendary [[Wand of Orcus|DMG]], which is described in the [[Dungeon Master's Guide]].

**Cultists of Orcus** See the Cult of Orcus in the [[MPMM]].

**Orcus's Lair** Orcus makes his lair in the fortress city of Naratyr, which is on Thanatos, the layer of the Abyss that he rules. Surrounded by a moat fed by the River Styx, Naratyr is an eerily quiet and cold city, its streets empty for hours at a time. The central castle of bone has interior walls of flesh and carpets made of woven hair. The city contains wandering Undead, many of which are engaged in continuous battles with one another.

**Wand of Orcus**. The wand has 7 charges, and any of its properties that require a saving throw have a save DC of 18. While holding it, Orcus can use an action to cast [[animate dead]], [[blight]], or [[speak with dead]]. Alternatively, he can expend 1 or more of the wand's charges to cast one of the following spells from it: [[circle of death]] (1 charge), [[finger of death]] (1 charge), or [[power word kill]] (2 charges). The wand regains [[1d4 + 3 charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, Orcus can use an action to conjure undead creatures whose combined average hit points don't exceed 500. These undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of Orcus and obey his commands until they are destroyed or until he dismisses them as an action. Once this property of the wand is used, the property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Orcus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. Orcus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. Orcus's weapon attacks are magical.

**Master of Undeath**. When Orcus casts [[animate dead]] or [[create undead]], he chooses the level at which the spell is cast, and the creatures created by the spells remain under his control indefinitely. Additionally, he can cast [[create undead]] even when it isn't night.

**Innate Spellcasting.** Orcus's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Orcus makes two Wand of Orcus attacks.

**Wand of Orcus**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (2d12) necrotic damage.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.

##### Legendary Actions

**A Taste of Undeath**. Orcus casts [[chill touch]] (17th level).

**Creeping Death (Costs 2 Actions)**. Orcus chooses a point on the ground that he can see within 100 feet of him. A cylinder of swirling necrotic energy 60 feet tall and with a 10-foot radius rises from that point and lasts until the end of Orcus's next turn. Creatures in that area have vulnerability to necrotic damage.
