### Su-monster
_Medium monstrosity, chaotic evil_

![[Su-monster.jpg]]

Su-monsters are cunning, wicked primates that inhabit forsaken wilderness areas and caves. Adults stand 5 feet tall and have long prehensile tails. Although they can grasp tools and weapons with their tails or clawed feet, su-monsters prefer to rend prey with their claws. Adult su-monsters can also project blasts of psionic energy that leave enemies [[stunned]] and unable to flee or defend themselves.

A su-monster sleeps while hanging upside down by its tail. While awake, it can also unleash a devastating attack from that position, rending with all four of its claws.

Su-monsters communicate silently by using their prehensile tails to make gestures. They typically kill more than they can eat, burying the leftovers and marking their location with the victim's possessions.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage, or 12 (4d4 + 2) slashing damage if the su-monster is hanging by its tail and all four of its limbs are free.

**Psychic Crush Recharge 5-6**. The su-monster targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or take 17 (5d6) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] for 1 minute. The [[stunned]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
