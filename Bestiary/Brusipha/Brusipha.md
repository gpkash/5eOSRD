**Demonic Ritual**. Brusipha can spend 3 hours performing a ritual that summons [[1d3 + 1 barlguras or 1 hezrou. She must sacrifice a Medium or larger living creature to Baphomet during this ritual, and the ritual can be performed only at night. The demons vanish at dawn.

**Labyrinthine Recall**. Brusipha can perfectly recall any path she has traveled.

**Spellcasting.** Brusipha casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Brusipha makes two Eldritch Blast attacks.

**Eldritch Blast**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) force damage.

**Gore**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. If Brusipha moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before she hit, the target takes an extra 4 (1d8) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet from Brusipha and have the [[prone]] condition.

**Incite the Hunters (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. Brusipha allows each ally within 30 feet of herself that has the Unerring Tracker trait to make one weapon attack as a reaction against the target of that ally's Unerring Tracker.

#### Reactions
**Baphomet's Blessing**. When Brusipha reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, she gains 8 temporary hit points.
