##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Anacreda makes two Claw attacks. She can replace one of the attacks with a Crushing Hug attack.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage.

**Crushing Hug**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 51 (8d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, Anacreda grabs it with both arms. The target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 18). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 73 (12d10 + 7) necrotic damage at the start of each of Anacreda's turns. Anacreda can't make attacks while grappling a creature in this way.

**Spinewall**. Anacreda causes a 50-foot-long, 5-foot-wide row of bones to pierce the earth at a point within 120 feet of her. She chooses the direction of the line. The bones rise 10 feet into the air and form a solid wall. A 5-foot section of bone has an AC of 20 and 10 hit points.

**Shattering Shriek (1/Day)**. Anacreda shrieks loud enough to shatter stone and bone alike. Each creature within a 50-foot-radius sphere centered on Anacreda must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 55 (10d10) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Unworked stone, exposed bone, and similar materials in the radius are shattered and turned into difficult terrain.
