**Advanced Telepathy**. The flumph can perceive the content of any telepathic communication used within 60 feet of it, and it can't be [[surprise|surprised]] by creatures with any form of telepathy.

**Prone Deficiency**. If the flumph is knocked [[prone]], roll a die. On an odd result, the flumph lands upside-down and is [[incapacitated]]. At the end of each of its turns, the flumph can make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, righting itself and ending the [[incapacitated]] condition if it succeeds.

**Telepathic Shroud**. The flumph is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as all divination spells.

##### Actions
**Tendrils**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) acid damage. At the end of each of its turns, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 2 (1d4) acid damage on a failure or ending the recurring acid damage on a success. A [[lesser restoration]] spell cast on the target also ends the recurring acid damage.

**Stench Spray (1/Day)**. Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from the flumph must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in a foul-smelling liquid. A coated creature exudes a horrible stench for 1d4 hours. The coated creature is [[poisoned]] as long as the stench lasts, and other creatures are [[poisoned]] while with in 5 feet of the coated creature. A creature can remove the stench on itself by using a short rest to bathe in water, alcohol, or vinegar.
