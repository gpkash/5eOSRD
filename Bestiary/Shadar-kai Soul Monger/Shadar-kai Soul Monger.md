**Fey Ancestry**. The shadar-kai has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put it to sleep.

**Magic Resistance**. The shadar-kai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Soul Thirst**. When it reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the shadar-kai can gain temporary hit points equal to half the creature's hit point maximum. While the shadar-kai has temporary hit points from this trait, it has advantage on attack rolls.

**Weight of Ages**. Any Beast or Humanoid (except an elf) that starts its turn within 5 feet of the shadar-kai has its speed reduced by 20 feet until the start of that creature's next turn.

**Spellcasting.** The shadar-kai casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The shadar-kai makes two Shadow Dagger attacks.

**Shadow Dagger**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (4d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 19 (3d12) necrotic damage, and the target has disadvantage on saving throws until the end of the shadar-kai's next turn. Hit or Miss: The dagger magically returns to the shadar-kai's hand immediately after a ranged attack.

**Wave of Weariness Recharge 4-6**. The shadar-kai emits weariness in a 60-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage and suffers 1 level of [[exhaustion]]. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and doesn't gain a level of [[exhaustion]].
