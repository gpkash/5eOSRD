### Athar Null
_Small, Medium humanoid, any alignment_

![[Athar Null.webp]]

The Athar deny the legitimacy of gods, believing the so-called deities are merely powerful spellcasters. To combat false gods, Athar nulls train to negate the powers of those with magic. Nulls work in the shadows, serving as assassins and spies for the Athar.

**Avoidance**. If the null is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take half as much damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and half as much damage if it fails.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The null makes two Force Dagger attacks.

**Force Dagger**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) force damage. Hit or Miss: The dagger magically returns to the null's hand immediately after a ranged attack.

#### Reactions
**Nullify Spell (3/Day)**. The null utters a magical word of cancelation to interrupt a creature it can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 4th level or higher, the null makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a successful check, the spell fails and has no effect.
