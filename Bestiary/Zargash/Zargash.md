### Zargash
_Medium humanoid (cleric, human), chaotic evil_

![[Zargash.jpg]]

Zargash worships Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undeath, who has promised to transform Zargash into a vampire after a lifetime of faithful service. For a living priest to worship Orcus is utter folly, but Zargash is twisted beyond any hope of redemption. His hobbies include slaying the living and animating the dead.

**Spellcasting.** Zargash casts one of the following spells, using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

- At will: [light](https://5e.tools/spells.html#light_phb), [thaumaturgy](https://5e.tools/spells.html#thaumaturgy_phb)
    
- 1/day each: [[command]], [[gaseous form]], [[hold person]], [[silence]], [[speak with dead]]

##### Actions
**Warhammer**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage, or 7 (1d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands.

**Deathly Ray**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 25 (4d10 + 3) necrotic damage.

Animate Corpse (1/Day). 

Zargash targets the lifeless corpse of one Humanoid he can see within 30 feet of him and commands it to rise, transforming it into a zombie under his control. The zombie takes its turn immediately after Zargash. Animating the zombie requires Zargash's [[concentration]] (as if [[concentrating]] on a spell). The zombie reverts to an inanimate corpse after 10 minutes, when it drops to 0 hit points, or when Zargash's [[concentration]] ends.
