**Brute**. A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the bugbear hits with it (included in the attack).

**Surprise Attack**. If the bugbear surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage from the attack.

**Heart of Hruggek**. The bugbear has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], [[frightened]], [[paralyzed]], [[poisoned]], [[stunned]], or put to sleep.

##### Actions
