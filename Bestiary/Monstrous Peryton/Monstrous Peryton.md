**Flyby**. The peryton doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Keen Sight and Smell**. The peryton has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If the peryton fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The peryton makes two attacks: one with its gore and one with its talons.

**Gore**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.

**Talons**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage.

**Warp Shadow**. The peryton chooses up to three creatures within 60 feet of it that it can see. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. While cursed, whenever the creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it must roll a d4 and subtract that number from the roll. A cursed creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this peryton's Warp Shadow for 24 hours.

##### Legendary Actions
**Detect**. The peryton makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Dive Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**. The peryton moves up to its speed toward one target of its choosing. It then makes a gore attack that deals an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage on a hit.
