**Spellcasting.** The warlock casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14): 

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The warlock makes two Rapier attacks, or it uses Bewildering Word twice.

**Rapier**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) piercing damage.

**Bewildering Word**. The warlock utters a magical bewilderment, targeting one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 9 (2d8) psychic damage and have disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of the warlock's next turn.

#### Reactions
**Misty Escape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. In response to taking damage, the warlock turns [[invisible]] and teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It remains [[invisible]] until the start of its next turn or until it attacks, makes a damage roll, or casts a spell.
