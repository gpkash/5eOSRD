### Werevulture
_Medium fiend, chaotic evil_

![[Werevulture.webp]]

Scholars believe the curse of the werevulture is related to vrocks, vulturelike demons known for their covetousness and their capricious violence. According to these scholars, a flock of vrocks descended on a Material Plane world through a planar rupture, leaving plagues and other afflictions in their wake. Many of those who were injured by the demons survived, and the survivors gratefully thanked their gods for their apparent good fortune. But during the next full moon, they transformed into the first werevultures: hideous, birdlike creatures who hungered for the flesh of the dead. In the years since, the curse has spread far and wide.

Werevultures appear perfectly ordinary when in humanoid shape. But by the light of the full moon—or at other times when they give in to the curse—they change. Foul wings burst painfully from their backs, and the hair falls from their heads, leaving their beaked faces bare and wrinkled. Werevultures feed on carrion, as ordinary vultures do, and they have a covetous nature, like vrocks. They follow travelers from high in the air, and when a pretty bauble catches their eye, they descend rapidly to slay the travelers and take their victims' treasures.

**Regeneration**. The werevulture regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the werevulture takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the werevulture's next turn. The werevulture dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
