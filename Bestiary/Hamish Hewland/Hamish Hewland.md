### Hamish Hewland
_Huge giant, neutral good_

![[Hamish Hewland token.png]]

A gentle giant with a ferocious laugh, Hamish hails from the city of Waterdeep. He was never one for the wilderness in his younger days, but he wanted adventure. He joined his friends, Sylvene and Artura, on their journey into the wilds of the Sword Coast, all those years ago, and was part of their adventuring party with a human from Secomber named Waltarn Everlake. That Hamish would be willing to risk his life to protect his friends was never in doubt.

Hamish has brown skin, great posture, and wears his long hair in three tidy braids. He is the sort of fellow who overpacks for an adventure. His pockets usually teem with snacks or rations. Being a giant, he brought both a dungeoneer's pack and an explorer's pack in his knapsack. He carries a big axe, suitable for his size. He also carried a round, wooden shield, made just for him by Artura, but it has rotted to bits.

**Personality Traits** "I am curious about the road not taken, sometimes to a fault. I try to always have food with me."


**Ideal** "Bravery. I would risk my life for true friends. In fact, I have!"


**Bond** "Friendships you choose can mean more than family. A friend made is an enemy defeated."


**Flaw** "I often believe in people to the point of being naive."
