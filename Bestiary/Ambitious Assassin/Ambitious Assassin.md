**Legendary Resistance (2/Day)**. If the assassin fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The assassin makes two Poison Blade attacks.

**Poison Blade**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) poison damage.

##### Legendary Actions
**Cunning**. The assassin escapes nonmagical restraints and ends the [[grappled]] condition on itself, then moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Stab (Costs 2 Actions)**. The assassin makes one Poison Blade attack.

**Vanishing Escape (Costs 3 Actions)**. The assassin creates a sudden distraction, such as a cloud of disorienting smoke or flash of dazzling light, filling a 10-foot cube within 5 feet of the assassin. Each creature of the assassin's choice in that area takes 9 (2d8) psychic damage, and the assassin has the [[invisible]] condition. This invisibility lasts until the end of the assassin's next turn.
