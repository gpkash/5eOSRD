The thunderous clash of conflict is part of the very nature of sapphire dragons. Militant and territorial, they defend their lairs fiercely, ambushing intruders and plotting assaults against their rivals. The sonic pulse of their breath weapon sows weakness, leaving the victims unable to fight back.


**Luminous Blue** Sapphire dragons' scales and wing membranes show varied shades of blue, ranging from the light tones of a spring sky to the rich, crystalline azure of sapphire gems and compressed glacial ice. In the light, the scales glitter and shine like luminous starbursts. The dragons' psionic nature is evident in the horn and bone structures of their bodies. Their tail barbs and horn tips are all separate pieces, but they float in place, held aloft by psychic energy while the dragons live. These levitating horns and spines shift slightly with the dragons' moods, bobbing in amusement or flaring with anger.


**Art of War** The warlike sapphire dragons devise strategies and ambushes based on their ability to maneuver underground. A sapphire dragon often refrains from striking immediately, preferring to assess intruders first in order to devise the most advantageous approach to dealing with them.

Sapphire dragons watch for signs of Aberrations and other creatures corrupted by the Far Realm. They frequently ally with emerald dragons, drawing on their kin's knowledge of occult phenomena to track the influence of the Far Realm. Armed with that knowledge, sapphire dragons stamp out alien influence before it spreads.

People who dwell or delve deep beneath the earth can easily find themselves at odds with a sapphire dragon if they cross into the dragon's territory. But sapphire dragons sometimes forge peaceful relationships with rock gnomes or deep gnomes, relying on these folk to help protect the territory surrounding their lairs.


**Martial Hoards** Sapphire dragons' favorite prizes are weapons and armor, records of military history and tactics, and magic items that protect against psychic damage or mental intrusion. The centerpiece of a sapphire dragon's hoard is usually a cataloged, orderly collection of war gear, which can contain ancient relics of immense power.

**Connected Creatures** Sapphire dragons are generally solitary creatures. On the rare occasion that one forms nonhostile relationships with other beings, it is almost always to bolster the defenses of the dragon's lair and hoard.

**Sapphire Dragon Lairs** Sapphire dragons make their lairs in enormous caverns and complex tunnel systems. As they grow older, they continually renovate their lairs, using their tunneling abilities and command over stone.

Sapphire dragons eventually create dizzying honeycombs of hidden passages, deceptively thin walls, and secret chambers that allow them to traverse the entire lair without ever being seen by intruders. The best-defended sapphire dragon lairs have no easily accessible entrances or exits at all, and trespassers who do find their way inside must then contend with a maze of corridors, dead ends, and steep inclines.

**Sapphire Dragon Lair Features** The sapphire dragon lair shown in map 5.12 is a series of natural tunnels and chambers the dragon has adapted to serve as a lair. The lair has few natural entrances, so whole sections are inaccessible without excavation or magic, as the dragon can simply open doorways in walls whenever necessary.

The lair has the following features:






**A Sapphire Dragon's Lair** Sapphire dragons make their homes in extensive cave systems. As they grow older, they make increasingly complex renovations to their lairs, using their inherent magic and natural tunneling abilities to great effect. Eventually, a sapphire dragon's lair is a dizzying honeycomb of hidden passages, deceptively thin walls, and secret chambers that allow the dragon to travel from one end to the other unseen by intruders. The most secure lairs might feature no accessible entrances or exits at all, with the dragon relying on tunneling or shaping stone to come and go.

The challenge rating of a legendary sapphire dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day)**. If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Spider Climb**. The dragon can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Tunneler**. The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and can choose to leave a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

**Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).** The dragon's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two melee attacks, one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) thunder damage.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence**. Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Debilitating Breath Recharge 5-6**. The dragon exhales a pulse of high-pitched, nearly inaudible sound in a 60-foot-cone. Each creature in that cone must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 45 (13d6) thunder damage and is [[incapacitated]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[incapacitated]].

##### Legendary Actions
**Tail Attack**. The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Telekinetic Fling**. The dragon chooses a Small or smaller object that isn't being worn or carried that it can see within 60 feet of it, and magically hurls the object at a creature it can see within 60 feet of the object. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (4d6) bludgeoning damage.

**Teleport (Costs 2 Actions)**. The dragon magically teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it.
