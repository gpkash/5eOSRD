### Irda Seeker
_Medium giant, any alignment_

![[Irda Seeker.webp]]

Irda seekers are skilled spies who use their magic to disguise themselves and gather intelligence for their allies. In combat, irda seekers can momentarily cloak themselves as they dart around the battlefield.


**Irda** The Dragon Queen created the irda long ago. While most irda embraced their wicked creator's teachings, some of them adopted the philosophies of other deities. Those irda who don't serve the Dragon Queen live in hidden communities across Krynn, avoiding the eyes of their creator and her minions.

Distantly related to oni, ogres, and other giant folk, irda have shimmering skin that ranges through shades of indigo and sea green. Their innate magic provides them with limited shape-shifting abilities and the power to create illusions.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The seeker uses Augment Physicality, if available, and makes two Crystal Blade attacks.

**Crystal Blade**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) force damage, plus 7 (2d6) force damage if the seeker is Large.

**Augment Physicality (1/Day)**. For 1 minute, the seeker magically heightens its physical ability and increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While augmented, the seeker is Large, and makes Strength and Dexterity saving throws with advantage. If the seeker lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.

**Change Shape (1/Day)**. The seeker magically transforms to look and feel like a Medium Humanoid it has seen. Any equipment the seeker is wearing or carrying isn't transformed, and the seeker's statistics don't change. The seeker reverts to its true form if the seeker is reduced to 0 hit points or if the seeker uses an action to end the transformation.
