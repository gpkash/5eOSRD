**Innate Spellcasting.** The mage's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14). It can cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

##### Actions
**Quarterstaff**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d6 - 1]]) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (1d8 - 1]]) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.

**Glimpse the Temporal Flood Recharge 5-6**. The mage targets one creature within 120 feet of it that it can see. The target takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn.

#### Reactions
**Precognitive Insight (3/Day)**. When the mage or a creature it can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the mage can cause the roll to be made with advantage or disadvantage.
