### Astral Dreadnought
_Gargantuan monstrosity (titan), unaligned_

![[Astral Dreadnought.webp]]

Enormous and terrifying, astral dreadnoughts haunt the silvery void of the Astral Plane, causing planar travelers to shudder at the very thought of them. Dreadnoughts have been gliding through the astral mists since the dawn of the multiverse, trying to devour all other creatures they encounter.

Covered from head to tail in layers of thick, spiked plates, a dreadnought has two gnarled limbs that end in magic-enhanced pincer claws. Constellations appear to swirl in the depths of its single eye, and its serpentine tail trails off into the silvery void. Anything it swallows is deposited in a unique demiplaneâ€”an enclosed space that contains eons worth of detritus, as well as the remains of travelers. The place has gravity and breathable air, and organic matter decays there. When the dreadnought dies, its demiplane vanishes, and its contents are released into the Astral Plane.

**Antimagic Cone**. The astral dreadnought's opened eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the [[antimagic field]] spell, in a 150-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the dreadnought decides which way the cone faces. The cone doesn't function while the dreadnought's eye is closed or while the dreadnought is [[blinded]].

**Astral Entity**. The astral dreadnought can't leave the Astral Plane, nor can it be banished or otherwise transported out of the Astral Plane.

**Demiplanar Donjon**. Any creature or object that the astral dreadnought swallows is transported to a demiplane that can be entered by no other means except a [[wish]] spell or this creature's Donjon Visit ability. A creature can leave the demiplane only by using magic that enables planar travel, such as the [[plane shift]] spell. The demiplane resembles a stone cave roughly 1,000 feet in diameter with a ceiling 100 feet high. Like a stomach, it contains the remains of the dreadnought's past meals. The dreadnought can't be harmed from within the demiplane. If the dreadnought dies, the demiplane disappears, and everything inside it appears around the corpse. The demiplane is otherwise indestructible.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If the astral dreadnought fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Weapons**. An astral dreadnought's weapon attacks are magical.

**Sever Silver Cord**. If the astral dreadnought scores a critical hit against a creature traveling through the Astral Plane by means of the [[astral projection]] spell, the dreadnought can cut the target's silver cord instead of dealing damage.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The astral dreadnought makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (5d10 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is a creature of Huge size or smaller and this damage reduces it to 0 hit points or it is [[incapacitated]], the astral dreadnought swallows it. The swallowed target, along with everything it is wearing and carrying, appears in an unoccupied space on the floor of the astral dreadnought's Demiplanar Donjon.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d6 + 9) slashing damage.

##### Legendary Actions
**Claw**. The astral dreadnought makes one claw attack.

**Donjon Visit (Costs 2 Actions)**. One creature that is Huge or smaller that the astral dreadnought can see within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or be magically teleported to an unoccupied space on the floor of the astral dreadnought's Demiplanar Donjon. At the end of the target's next turn, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

**Psychic Projection (Costs 3 Actions)**. Each creature within 60 feet of the astral dreadnought must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw, taking 15 (2d10 + 4) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
