### Orthon
_Large fiend (devil), lawful evil_

![[Orthon.webp]]

When an archduke of the Nine Hells needs a creature tracked, found, and either done away with or captured, the task usually falls to an orthon. These devils are infernal bounty hunters, tireless in their pursuit of their quarry across the multiverse.

Orthons are infamous for their sharp senses. Because an orthon can become invisible at will, its quarry is often unaware of being hunted until the orthon strikes. This invisibility can be disrupted when the devil is attacked, however, so a strong counterattack is often the best defense against it.

Orthons value the challenge of the chase and the thrill of one-on-one combat above all else. An orthon's first loyalty is to its archduke, but one with no immediate assignment might work for anyone who promises it a worthy struggle against a lethal foe. Because they travel widely, orthons are unequaled as guides through the layers of the Nine Hells.

**Invisibility Field**. The orthon can use a bonus action to become [[invisible]]. Any equipment the orthon wears or carries is also [[invisible]] as long as the equipment is on its person. This invisibility ends immediately after the orthon makes an attack roll or is hit by an attack.

**Magic Resistance**. The orthon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

#### Reactions
**Explosive Retribution**. When it is reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, the orthon causes itself to explode. All other creatures within 30 feet of it must each make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This explosion destroys the orthon, its infernal dagger, and its brass crossbow.
