### Nabassu
_Medium fiend (demon), chaotic evil_

![[Nabassu.webp]]

The insatiable nabassus prowl the multiverse in search of souls to devour. If they think they can kill a creature and consume its soul, they attack—even if that other creature is a demon, including another nabassu.

Most other demons shun nabassus and force them to live on the fringes of the Abyss. There, nabassus pick off weaker demons or, if the situation warrants, gather in packs to take down larger prey. Some especially powerful nabassus even search for demon lords' amulets.

Whenever magic pulls demons from the Abyss to the Material Plane, nabassus try to get summoned so that they can embark on a feast of souls there. A summoned nabassu seeks to break free so that it can devour the soul of its summoner and then feed on the souls of whatever other creatures it can catch. One way a summoner can avoid this fate is by providing a steady supply of souls to the nabassu, which might persuade the demon to be cooperative—as long as the supply lasts.

**Demonic Shadows**. The nabassu darkens the area around its body in a 10-foot radius. Nonmagical light can't illuminate this area of dim light.

**Devour Soul**. A nabassu can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided that creature is neither a construct nor an undead. The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice (d8s) equal to half the creature's number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu's hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 Hit Dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage on a hit. The nabassu retains these benefits for 6 days. A creature devoured by a nabassu can be restored to life only by a [[wish]] spell.

**Magic Resistance**. The nabassu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**. The nabassu's weapon attacks are magical.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The nabassu uses its Soul-Stealing Gaze and makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its bite.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (4d12 + 6) piercing damage.

**Soul-Stealing Gaze**. The nabassu targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the nabassu and isn't a construct or an undead, it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or reduce its hit point maximum by 13 (2d12) damage and give the nabassu an equal number of temporary hit points. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0, and if the target is a humanoid, it immediately rises as a [[ghoul]] under the nabassu's control.
