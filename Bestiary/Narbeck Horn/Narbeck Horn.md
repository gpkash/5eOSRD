**Brave**. The knight has advantage on saving throws against being [[frightened]].

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The knight makes two melee attacks.

**Greatsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**Heavy Crossbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d10) piercing damage.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. For 1 minute, the knight can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is [[incapacitated]].

#### Reactions
**Parry**. The knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
