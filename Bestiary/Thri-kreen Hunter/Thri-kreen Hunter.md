##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The thri-kreen makes two Gythka or Chatkcha attacks.

**Gythka**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage.

**Chatkcha**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

#### Reactions
**Parry**. The thri-kreen adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the thri-kreen must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
