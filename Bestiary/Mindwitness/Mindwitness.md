### Mindwitness
_Large aberration, lawful evil_

![[Mindwitness.webp]]

If a beholder is [[stunned]] and brought to the brine pool of an elder brain, the beholder can be converted into a mindwitness. This alters some of its eye rays and transforms four of its eyestalks into tentacles similar to a mind flayer's. The mindwitness is psychically imprinted with devotion to the elder brain and submission to illithid commands.

A mindwitness's primary function is to improve telepathic communication in a mind flayer colony. A creature in telepathic communication with a mindwitness can converse through it to as many as seven other creatures the mindwitness can see, rapidly disseminating commands and other information.

If separated from its illithid masters, a mindwitness seeks out other telepathic creatures to tell it what to do. Mindwitnesses have been known to ally with [[flumph||flumphs]] and planar beings such as demons, shifting their worldview and alignment to match those of their new masters.
