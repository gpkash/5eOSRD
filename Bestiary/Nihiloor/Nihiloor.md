**Magic Resistance**. The mind flayer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).** The mind flayer's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

##### Actions
**Tentacles**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be [[stunned]] until this grapple ends.

**Extract Brain**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one [[incapacitated]] humanoid [[grappled]] by the mind flayer. Hit: The target takes 55 (10d10) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

**Mind Blast Recharge 5-6**. The mind flayer magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (4d8 + 4) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
