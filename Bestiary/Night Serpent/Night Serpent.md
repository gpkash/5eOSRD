# Night Serpent
*Large monstrosity, neutral evil*

Night serpents are predatory creatures that specialize in nocturnal ambushes, featuring scales as dark as the night sky and hearts equally ominous. Their venom surpasses the potency of regular snakes, but the most frightening aspect lies in their ability to seamlessly blend with ambient darkness, making them nearly invisible to their victims until it's too late.

These serpents possess bodies partially composed of shadow, granting them immunity to poison and providing some resistance against various forms of destructive energy and conventional weapons.
