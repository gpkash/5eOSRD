### Fox
_Tiny beast, unaligned_

![[Fox.jpg]]

The white arctic foxes of Icewind Dale live in burrows and are acclimated to cold weather. They prowl the outskirts of Ten-Towns and nearby forests for food, hunting hares or stealing fish. These timid creatures avoid contact with humanoids, but they are sometimes used as mounts by [[Chwinga|ToA|chwingas]].
