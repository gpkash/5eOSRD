### Urstul Floxin
_Medium humanoid (Illuskan human), lawful evil_

![[Urstul Floxin.webp]]

Urstul Floxin works for Manshoon, and he is the highest-ranking member of the Zhentarim squad stationed at House Gralhund. Urstul is a glorified thug with all the charm and breeding of a snake, but the Gralhunds tolerate him because he feeds them useful information culled from his spies throughout the city. Urstul takes his orders from Manshoon's current simulacrum, which comes and goes from House Gralhund by way of a teleportation circle (connected to the circle in Kolat Towers).

Urstul is a large, heavyset man in his forties. He storms about House Gralhund like he owns the place. He has a collection of black flying snakes that he uses as couriers to deliver messages to underlings throughout the city.

**Assassinate**. During its first turn, Urstul has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Urstul scores against a [[surprise|surprised]] creature is a critical hit.

**Evasion**. If Urstul is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Urstul instead takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn)**. Urstul deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Urstul that isn't [[incapacitated]] and Urstul doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
