### Eyedrake
_Large aberration, lawful evil_

![[Eyedrake.webp]]

When a beholder contends with a dragon for power and wealth, its thoughts of its dragon rival can become deeply obsessive, eventually pervading the beholder's dreams. If the rivalry lasts long enough, these fevered dreams can manifest as an eyedrakeâ€”a beholder-like creature with draconic features.

An eyedrake resembles a winged draconic creature with no true limbs and a perpetually open mouth. Inside that mouth is a large eye that emits a breath-like wave of antimagic energy. The creature's wings are formed from multiple eyestalks, each of which can fire magical rays that combine aspects of a dragon's breath weapon attacks and a beholder's eye rays.

An eyedrake left to its own devices exhibits much of the stereotypical behavior of a young dragon, attempting to establish a lair and a hoard. Driven by instinct to jealously defend its hoard, an eyedrake fights to the death if anything threatens even the smallest trinket it claims as its own.
