### Zindar
_Medium humanoid (half-dragon), lawful good_

![[Zindar.jpg]]

This half-gold dragon runs Port Nyanzaru's docks and keeps track of ship manifests. A sorcerer of impressive ability, Zindar is well paid by the merchant princes for his work. He is also a key member of the Ytepka Society and a great source of information about the city. Zindar has a soft spot for adventurers, but he knows the dangers of Chult well enough to understand that most of those who embark on expeditions to explore the jungle never return.

Zindar makes extensive use of spells in his day-today work, casting message to deliver missives to dock workers, detect thoughts for reading ship captains' minds, knock for unsealing containers for inspection, clairvoyance for peering into ship holds, dominate beast to pacify nervous animals, and so forth.


**Zindar's Traits** **Ideal** "I take pride in my work, and I like to keep all my business dealings honest."


**Bond** "Port Nyanzaru is my home. I take a dim view of those who would bring harm to the city and its inhabitants."


**Flaw** "I don't get mad. I get even."
