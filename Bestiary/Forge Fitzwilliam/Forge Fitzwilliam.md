### Forge Fitzwilliam
_Medium humanoid, neutral evil_

![[Forge Fitzwilliam.jpg]]

Forge Fitzwilliam is a con artist who manipulates others with lies and flattery. The audacious criminal has left a trail of broken promises and false identities along the Sword Coast. He conceals flexible morals and a ready dagger behind his winning smile.

Forge enjoys the finer things in life, particularly when they result from his own cleverness. Decades of heists and cons haven't slaked his thirstâ€”in fact, his ambitions only grow grander with time.

**Disarming Charm**. While Forge isn't wearing armor, his AC includes his Charisma modifier.

**Double-Cross**. If Forge hits a creature friendly to him with an attack roll, the attack is automatically a critical hit.

**Evasion**. If Forge is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if he fails, provided he isn't [[incapacitated]].

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Forge makes two Dagger attacks, two Heavy Crossbow attacks, or one of each.

**Dagger**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 24 (7d6) poison damage, and the target is [[poisoned]] until the end of its next turn.

**Heavy Crossbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage plus 24 (7d6) poison damage. Hit or Miss: If the target is a creature, it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of Forge's next turn.

#### Reactions
**Uncanny Dodge**. Forge halves the damage he takes from an attack that hits him. He must be able to see the attacker.
