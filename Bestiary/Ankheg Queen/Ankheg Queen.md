##### Actions

_**Bite**_. _Melee Weapon Attack_: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit_: 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage plus 9 (2d6) acid damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the ankheg can bite only the grappled creature and has advantage on the attack rolls to do so.

_**Acid Spray (Recharge 6)**_. The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 60-feet long and 5 feet wide, provided that it has no creature grappled. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
