### The Wretched
_Small monstrosity, lawful evil_

![[The Wretched.webp]]

**The Wretched** Horrid little monsters, the Wretched gather in large packs to scour the Shadowfell for prey. These pitiful entities subsist on life force, so when they find a creature, they surge forward to sink their fangs into their victims and drink deep of their life energy and their fear.


**Sorrowsworn** The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. The sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering that are inherent to the shadowy landscape, and they visit horror on those who stumble into their midst.


**Emotion Given Form** Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress. Some are manifestations of anger; others are loneliness given physical form. Their nature provides a clue both to understanding how they become more powerful and to overcoming them. Giving in to the negative emotions that the sorrowsworn represent causes these entities to grow deadlier. Fighting against these emotions can weaken them and drive them away.

##### Lore

History DC 15: The wretched are spawned from feelings of self-loathing and inadequacy, common among petitioners in the shadowfell who travel to its edges to evade their final judgement.

Nature DC 15: The wretched are obligate pack hunters, latching on to prey and draining it of life force, heedless of their own safety. This reckless fervor often leads them to charge headlong into quagmires and off of cliffs in pursuit of prey.

##### Tactics

The wretched mass in groups of 10-20 and surge directly toward the nearest foe, choosing the next-closest foe only if the closest is too surrounded to reach. They attempt to leap or climb over obstacles, rather than seeking a path around them.

**Wretched Pack Tactics**. The Wretched has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the Wretched's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]]. The Wretched otherwise has disadvantage on attack rolls.

##### Actions
**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d10 + 1) piercing damage, and the Wretched attaches to the target. While attached, the Wretched can't attack, and at the start of each of the Wretched's turns, the target takes 6 (1d10 + 1) necrotic damage. The attached Wretched moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the Wretched's movement. The Wretched can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach a Wretched.
