### Mage Hunter
_Large monstrosity, lawful evil_

![[Mage Hunter.webp]]

Mage hunters are hideous spider-legged creatures employed by the Oriq to pursue magic-wielders. These creatures can naturally sense magic via the glowing purple spines on their backs.

A mage hunter is usually in its sentry form, a diamond-shaped drone with a heightened ability to sense and locate mages. Once it finds a quarry, the mage hunter takes on its arachnoid hunter form and pursues its targets with vicious skill.

**Magic Sense**. The hunter knows the location of every spellcaster, active spell, and magic item within 120 feet of itself.

**Spider Climb (Hunter Form Only)**. The hunter can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

##### Actions
**Multiattack (Hunter Form Only)**. The hunter makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw (Hunter Form Only)**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage.

**Tail**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the hunter can't make a Tail attack against another target.

**Mage Tracker (Sentry Form Only)**. The hunter emits a pulse of energy that helps it better locate its magical quarry. Each creature within 120 feet of the hunter that has the ability to cast spells must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be mystically marked by the hunter for 1 hour. While marked, a creature can't become hidden from the hunter and gains no benefit from the [[invisible]] condition against the hunter. Additionally, while a marked creature is on the same plane of existence as the hunter, the hunter always knows the distance and direction to the creature.

#### Reactions
**Consume and Destroy**. When the hunter takes damage from a spell, it takes only half the triggering damage (rounded down). If the creature that cast the spell is within 60 feet of the hunter, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take the other half of the damage.
