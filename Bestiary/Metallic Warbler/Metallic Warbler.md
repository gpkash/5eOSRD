### Metallic Warbler
_Tiny construct, neutral good_

![[Metallic Warbler.jpg]]

Metallic warblers resemble songbirds and serve as clandestine agents of their creators, keeping watch over communities without directly intervening. Their telepathic bond lets them summon their dragon creators in case of dire need.


**Metallic Sentinels** A metallic sentinel is a guardian created by a metallic dragon, forged from the metal associated with its creator and powered by the energy of the dragon's breath. An artificial being sculpted in elegant filigree, it is dedicated to defusing tensions that could spiral into violence.

**Immutable Form**. The warbler is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Telepathic Bond**. While the warbler is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically with each other.

##### Actions
**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage.

**Calming Mist Recharge 5-6**. The warbler releases a calming gas in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Charisma saving throw or become [[charmed]] by the warbler for 1 minute. While [[charmed]] in this way, the creature is [[incapacitated]] and has a speed of 0.
