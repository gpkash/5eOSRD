**Draconic Essence**. When you summon the drake, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. The chosen type determines the drake's damage immunity, the damage of its bite, and the damage of its Infused Strikes trait.

##### Actions
**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ 3 + PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d6 piercing damage plus PB damage of a type determined by the drake's Draconic Essence.

#### Reactions
**Infused Strikes**. When another creature within 30 feet of the drake that it can see hits with a weapon attack, the drake infuses the strike with its essence, causing the attack to deal an extra 1d6 damage of the type determined by its Draconic Essence.
