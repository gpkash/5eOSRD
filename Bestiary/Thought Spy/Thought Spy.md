### Thought Spy
_Medium humanoid (any race), neutral evil_

![[Thought Spy token.png]]

Thought spies form the backbone of House Dimir's covert operations. They are trained in stealth and infiltration, tactics that they supplement with rigorously developed mental abilities. To ensure that no secrets slip through Dimir's fingers, they infiltrate rival guilds. In addition to traditional means of gathering intelligence, thought spies use their magic to spy on the thoughts of their targets.
