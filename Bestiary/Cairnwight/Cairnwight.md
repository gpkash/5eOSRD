### Cairnwight
_Huge undead, neutral_

![[Cairnwight.jpg]]

Stone giants believe the god Skoraeus Stonebones inspires artists to create their finest stone carvings. Sometimes a giant pursues this divine inspiration to the exclusion of all other tasks, retreating into a spacious cavern and blocking out all distractions. Creating a masterwork can become such a driving obsession that death can't stop it: a giant who dies while creating art might rise as a cairnwight and continue the work. Once the artwork is completed, the cairnwight remains as its undying guardian.

A cairnwight looks much like an emaciated stone giant. Its form is caked with lichens and mineral deposits, which help it blend with its cavern tomb. Should a creature attempt to interfere with the completion of the cairnwight's project, damage the art, or steal from the cairnwight, the giant petrifies the creature, places the resulting statue outside as a warning, then reseals its cavern vault.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The cairnwight makes two Slam attacks or two Rock attacks, and it uses its Petrifying Touch if available.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Petrifying Touch Recharge 5-6**. The cairnwight touches one creature it can see within 10 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 26 (4d12) force damage and have the [[restrained]] condition as it begins to turn to stone. The affected target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends on the target. On a failed save, the target has the [[petrified]] condition instead of the [[restrained]] condition.
