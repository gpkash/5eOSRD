### Gigant
_Gargantuan monstrosity, unaligned_

![[Gigant.jpg]]

A gigant is a towering insectile creature variously regarded as a harbinger of doom, a defender of nature, and a divine messenger of mysterious purpose. Giants regard them as a plague, since gigants prefer giants over other food. Some giants claim gigants are created by the weird magical aura that surrounds a gargantua.

A gigant resembles an enormous beetle with legs ending in sharp talons. It uses its talons to bring creatures to its enormous mandibles, which are strong enough to carry a giant to the gigant's nest to be devoured.

A gigant's wings are usually folded under its carapace, but the speedy flier can also beat its wings to create a horrible sound or to spread a toxic dust.

**Spell-Resistant Carapace**. The gigant has advantage on saving throws against spells, and any creature that makes a spell attack against the gigant has disadvantage on the attack roll.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The gigant makes one Mandibles attack and two Talons attacks.

**Mandibles**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 (4d6 + 7) slashing damage, and the target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 17). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 21 (4d6 + 7) slashing damage at the start of each of the gigant's turns. While the gigant is grappling a target, it can't use Mandibles against other targets.

**Talons**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d6 + 7) slashing damage, and the target is pulled 10 feet straight toward the gigant.

**Scale Dust Recharge 5-6**. The gigant releases magical dust from its wings in a 30-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a success or failure, the creature has the [[poisoned]] condition for 1 hour. While [[poisoned]] this way, the creature can't regain hit points.
