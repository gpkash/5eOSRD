Tiberius Inuus is a powerful paladin of Sune and head of the Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose, a holy order of warriors and paladins sworn to the service of the goddess of beauty. He is devoted to spreading the love and beauty of Sune to every corner of Faerûn.

Tiberius and his twin, Naes, were born in the city of Waterdeep. Their father abandoned them when their mother, a cleric of Sune, died during childbirth and thus they were raised in the Temple of Beauty. Naes grew up to become a cleric and man of peace, but Tiberius was too filled with anger to follow that path. While his twin was able to forgive their father, Tiberius has used the anger from that abandonment to fuel his drive to destroy anything that threatens the Church of Sune.

Tiberius dreams of building the Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose into the greatest military force for good in all Faerûn, free from the corruption of city state politics. When he finds a warrior whose ability he respects, Tiberius can be an extremely convincing evangelizer. Tiberius often leverages the large number of faithful amongst the nobility of the Lord's Alliance. He is able to ensure that the Ruby Rose are included in important battles against threats to the cities of the Sword Coast. While the veterans of the Order of the Gauntlet might view clerics of Sune as soft, they respect the Ruby Rose because of the efforts of Tiberius.

**Tiberius as a Contact** Tiberius is the primary contact for members of the Church of Sune at low levels. Items can be purchased from Tiberius. It takes a day for him to acquire the item from the church.
