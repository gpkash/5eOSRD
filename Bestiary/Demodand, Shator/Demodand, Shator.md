**Poisonous Spit Recharge 5-6**. The shator exhales poisonous spit in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) acid damage on a failed save and becoming [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the [[paralyzed]] effect on itself on a success. The creature takes 18 (4d8) acid damage on a successful save.
