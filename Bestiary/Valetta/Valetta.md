**Divine Eminence**. As a bonus action, Valetta can expend a spell slot to cause her melee weapon attacks to magically deal an extra 10 (3d6) radiant damage to a target on a hit. This benefit lasts until the end of the turn. If Valetta expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.

**Spellcasting.** Valetta is a 5th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom. Valetta has the following cleric spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): [[5eOSRD/Spellcasting/Spells/Light/Light|Light]], [[sacred flame]], [[thaumaturgy]]
1st level (4 slots): [[cure wounds]], [[guiding bolt]], [[sanctuary]]
2nd level (3 slots): [[lesser restoration]], [[spiritual weapon]]
3rd level (2 slots): [[dispel magic]], [[spirit guardians]]

##### Actions
**Breathe Weapon**. Valetta can use her action to exhale a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot line of lightning (but can't do this again until she finishes a short or long rest); each creature in the line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Mace**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.
