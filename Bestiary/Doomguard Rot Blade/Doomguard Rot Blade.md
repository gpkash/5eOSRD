##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The rot blade makes two Entropic Blade or Entropic Javelin attacks.

**Entropic Blade**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. A creature killed by this attack has its body and everything it is wearing or carrying, except for magic items, reduced to ash. Hit or Miss: The rot blade can cause the blade to emit a burst of entropic magic in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the weapon. Each creature in that area other than the rot blade must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 6 (1d12) necrotic damage. The blade can emit entropic magic in this way only once per turn.

**Entropic Javelin**. _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 13 (2d12) necrotic damage. A creature killed by this attack has its body and everything it is wearing or carrying, except for magic items, reduced to ash.
