### Abyssal Chicken
_Tiny fiend (demon), chaotic evil_

![[Abyssal Chicken.webp]]

Abyssal chickens are carnivorous, temperamental, tasty bottom-feeders native to the Abyss. They beat their leathery wings to scare predators and to help them run faster, and they taste like fatty chicken.

With your permission, a character who casts the [[find familiar]] spell can henceforth choose to conjure an abyssal chicken instead of a raven.
