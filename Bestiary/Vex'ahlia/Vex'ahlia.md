**Assassinate**. During her first turn, Vex has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Vex scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

**Evasion**. If Vex is subjected to an effect that allows her to make a Dexterity saving throws to take only half damage, she instead takes no damage if she succeeds on the saving throws, and only half damage if she fails.

**Fey Ancestry**. Vex has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put her to sleep.

**Ranged Master**. Vex's ranged weapon attacks have a +2 bonus to hit (included in attacks), and ignore [[half cover]] and [[three-quarters cover]], and have no range penalty. Additionally, Vex can take a âˆ’5 penalty to any ranged attack roll to gain a +10 bonus to the damage roll.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn)**. Vex deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when she hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Vex that isn't [[incapacitated]] and she doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Special Equipment**. Vex wears [[+2 Studded White Dragon Leather Armor of Cold Resistance]] and a [[+2 Ring of Protection|ring of protection with a +2 bonus]]. She carries a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Magic/Broom of Flying/Broom of Flying]] and a [[Raven's Slumber]], and wields [[Fenthras (Exalted)|Fenthras]].

**Trinket**. [[5eOSRD/Bestiary/Trinket/Trinket]] moves and acts on Vex's turn, and Vex can use a bonus action to command him to take the [[ Dash]], [[ Dodge]], [[ Disengage]], or [[ Attack]] action. She can also command him to [[ Attack]] as part of her Multiattack action (see below). [[5eOSRD/Bestiary/Trinket/Trinket]] can take only one action on each of Vex's turns.

**Spellcasting.** Vex is a 13th-level spellcaster. Her spell-casting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following ranger spells prepared:

1st level (4 slots): [[cure wounds]], [[hunter's mark]]
2nd level (3 slots): [[pass without trace]], [[protection from poison]]
3rd level (3 slots): [[lightning arrow]], [[nondetection]]
4th level (1 slots): [[freedom of movement]], [[grasping vine]]

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Vex makes two ranged attacks, and can command [[5eOSRD/Bestiary/Trinket/Trinket]] to move up to his speed and use his Multiattack action.

**Fenthras**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, range 600 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (1d8 + 18) piercing damage and 3 (1d6) lightning damage, and Vex can use the following ability:

**Bramble Shot (2/[[Short Rest]])**. The attack deals an extra 18 (4d8) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throws or be [[restrained]]. The target can repeat the saving throws at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
