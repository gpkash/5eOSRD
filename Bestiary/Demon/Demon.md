### Demon
_Large fiend (demon), chaotic evil_

![[Demon.webp]]

Demons are artificial creatures, carefully constructed and imbued with aether according to a pattern called the Dark Schematic. Unknown artificers of the ancient past devised this blueprintâ€”perhaps in an attempt to imitate the angels, or possibly to replicate native demons that have since been hunted to extinction. Just as angels embody white mana and the construction phase of the Aether Cycle, demons are ravenous incarnations of black mana that feast on aether. They raid night markets, pillage airships, and break into refinement plants seeking aether to slake their thirst, causing as much destruction as possible in the process. They can thus be imagined as an embodiment of the reclamation stage of the Aether Cycle.

Artificers execute the Dark Schematic only in great desperation, often in the course of seeking power for themselves or revenge against their enemies. The destructive might of demons is hard to control, though, and these creatures have no particular regard for or gratitude toward their creators. As often as not, even an inventor who performs the steps necessary to create a demon with the utmost care suffers the same dismal fate as all its other victims.

Demons resemble angels on a superficial level, wearing ornate masks and headdresses, and often armored. The aether a demon consumes marks its skin with whorls of fiery red, deep purple, or searing yellow.

The statistics of an [[erinyes]] work well for demons on Kaladesh, but their weapons deal extra necrotic damage rather than extra poison damage.

**Magic Resistance**. The vrock has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.

**Beak**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Talons**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.

**Spores Recharge 6**. A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]]. While [[poisoned]] in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.

**Stunning Screech (1/Day)**. The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of the vrock's next turn.
