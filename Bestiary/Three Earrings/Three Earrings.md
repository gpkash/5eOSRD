### Three Earrings
_Medium humanoid (any race), chaotic good evil_

![[Three Earrings token.png]]

This pale, spotted, Tabaxi bandit captain is a low-ranking member of the Revelry pirates. She brought her vessel to the village of Palma Flora because she was informed that a local sahuagin tribe had uncovered an unusual treasure. Three Earrings rightly assumed that they were going to attack the village, and she intended to be there to plunder the ruins after the attack. She didn't anticipate Flora Isle sinking.
