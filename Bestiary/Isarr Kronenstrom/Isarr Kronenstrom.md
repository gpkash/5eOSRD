### Isarr Kronenstrom
_Medium humanoid (human), chaotic evil_

![[Isarr Kronenstrom token.png]]

The Wolf Tribe has been without a king or queen for years. Its most powerful chieftain, Isarr Kronenstrom, is a psychotic brute who worships Malar the Beast Lord. He hunts Ten-Towners for sport, bathes in their blood, and strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. Several members of Isarr's clan have deserted him or been killed off, but the few that remain are fiercely loyal. They believe, incorrectly, that he's the Chosen of Malar.

Although Isarr calls himself the Wolf King, few others in the Wolf Tribe support him in that claim, but the other Wolf clan chieftains are too weak and disorganized to challenge him.
