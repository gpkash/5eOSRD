The Big Water Slurpent is a magical creature that has lived within the Big Water for centuries. It was created by a wizard to guard the tower that has long since sunk into the Big Water. Many goblins have seen the slurpent and have run away. Many goblins believe that it likes to eat goblins.

The Big Water Slurpent is dangerous if goblins go snooping around the Big Water. But there are ways to get around it if you do one of the following:
