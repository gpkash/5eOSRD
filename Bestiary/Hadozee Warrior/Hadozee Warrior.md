**Glide**. If it isn't [[incapacitated]] or wearing heavy armor, the hadozee can extend its skin membranes to move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it descends in the air.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The hadozee makes two Shortsword attacks.

**Shortsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Light Crossbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.

#### Reactions
**Safe Descent**. When it would take damage from a fall, the hadozee extends its skin membranes to reduce the fall's damage to 0, provided it isn't wearing heavy armor.

**Uncanny Dodge**. The hadozee halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it, provided it can see the attacker.
