### Red Ruin
_Medium humanoid, lawful evil_

![[Red Ruin.webp]]

Known for her incredible awareness and reflexes, the dragonnel-flying ace Red Ruin leads the Red Dragon Army's airborne forces. Her actual name is unknown, leading her allies to refer to her merely as "commander" or "Red Ruin"â€”a sobriquet earned after razing numerous targets from the air. She rarely removes her distinctive dragonnel-shaped helmet, leading to speculation about her actual identity. She also speaks little, relying on sharp hand gestures to direct dragonnel-riders in flight.

**Draconic Devotion**. While Red Ruin can see a Dragon that isn't hostile to her, she has advantage on attack rolls.

**Mounted Combat Master**. When Red Ruin is mounted and a creature targets her mount with an attack, Red Ruin can cause the attack to target her instead.

**Mounted Evasion**. When Red Ruin or her mount makes a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage from an effect, they take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Red Ruin makes three Ember Lance attacks.

**Ember Lance**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d12 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or fall [[prone]].

**Explosive Hand Crossbow Recharge 5-6**. Red Ruin fires an explosive crossbow bolt at a point she can see within 120 feet of herself. When the bolt reaches that point, or if it hits an object early, it detonates in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
