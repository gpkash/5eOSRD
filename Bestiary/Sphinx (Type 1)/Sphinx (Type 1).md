### Sphinx (Type 1)
_Large monstrosity, lawful neutral_

![[Sphinx.webp]]

Utterly inscrutable, sphinxes are mysterious creatures known for their wisdom and knowledge. Closely aligned with blue mana, they are utterly devoted to gaining and possessing knowledge—but not to sharing or acting upon it. Sphinxes are content to search out the mysteries of Zendikar, then sit in quiet contemplation of what they have learned. To them, everything is an intellectual exercise, including conversation. They are famously oblique, answering questions with questions and posing riddles to test the acuity of others.

Sphinxes choose remote locations for their lairs, preferring sites of great natural beauty such as waterfalls, high promontories, and small islands. They jealously protect their lairs from other sphinxes and large predators, such as dragons, but they pay little attention to smaller visitors. A sphinx's lair is often difficult to reach, and typically involves treacherous climbing for creatures without the ability to fly. A visitor who can reach the spot is often rewarded with an audience—but those who come in search of answers are likely to leave disappointed.

Either sphinx in the Monster Manual can represent the various sphinxes of Zendikar.
