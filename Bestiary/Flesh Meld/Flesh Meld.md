### Flesh Meld
_Huge aberration, chaotic evil_

![[Flesh Meld.jpg]]

Squelching and quivering with insatiable hunger, a flesh meld is a hulking amalgamation of teeth, blood, and body parts. Sinuous appendages of gore, each ending in a gnashing mouth, bite at prey before yanking the piteous creatures into the flesh meld's core. The stench of death surrounds a flesh meld.

When a creature is consumed by a flesh meld, the creature's mind is merged into the flesh meld's consciousness. More resilient minds may fight against this assimilation, but inevitably, the mind succumbs to the discordant chorus of thoughts to kill and consume.
