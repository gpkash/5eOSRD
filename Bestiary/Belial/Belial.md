### Belial
_Medium fiend (devil), lawful evil_

![[Belial.jpg]]

Belial maintains his image as the most carnal of all archdevils, and enjoys inflicting pain as much as experiencing pleasure. Despite his indulgences, Belial demonstrates charisma, passion, and intelligence, and is almost always scheming. He is confident to a fault, with vanity and desire being his greatest weaknesses.

Phlegethos has been ruled by Belial, together with his daughter, Fierna, for almost as long as Dispater has ruled his Iron City. Belial considers himself an "old school" devil, alongside his friendly rivals Levistus and Dispater. Glasya's recent rise to power has him concerned for his continued relevance in the political landscape, forcing him to direct his scheming inwards.

During the Reckoning, Belial remained relatively neutral, until the end, when he allied with Baalzebul. Some argue that his alliance was just another scheme meant to misdirect Asmodeusâ€”an idea further cemented when, instead of being deposed, Belial was forced to cede the throne to his daughter. For a time, he continued to rule from the shadows, but influence from Glasya on Fierna has encouraged the fiery lord to rule in tandem. Belial manages much of the political and official sides of the realm, including maintaining the infernal court. He occasionally sends avatars to other planes, which quickly seek out pleasure before continuing their assigned task.

Similar to his daughter, Belial remains one of the most attractive archdevils. His rugged good looks and masculine physique serve to compliment his devilish features, of which he has many. Sharp horns and glowing eyes adorn his face, with midnight-black wings and a tail decorating the rest of his body. Depending on his mood, Belial's skin either takes on an ashy-grey complexion, or smolders red like dying coal. Priding himself on his sensual appearance, Belial dresses provocatively while maintaining high fashion, truly embodying his carnal desires.

**Belial's Lair** This fierce archdevil currently makes his lair in an obsidian palace built within the confines of Abriymoch, but his reach extends throughout the entirety of the city.

**Deep Wounds**. All damage dealt by Belial can only be restored through magical means.

**Devil's Sight**. Magical darkness doesn't impede Belials darkvision.

**Fear Aura**. When a creature starts their turn within 120 feet of Belial, they must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[frightened]] condition until they leave the aura. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect for 1 hour.

**Fiendish Regeneration**. Belial regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes radiant damage this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Belial dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**. If Belial fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. Belial has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Belial makes three attacks using his Ranseur of Torture.

**Ranseur of Torture**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +18 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target's movement speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn. This penalty can stack.

**Walls of Phlegethos**. Belial creates a wall of fire on a solid surface within 120 feet of him. The wall is 20 feet high and 1 foot thick, and Belial can make the wall up to 60 feet long or create a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter. The wall is opaque and lasts until Belial dismisses it. When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn inside the wall, or within 5 feet of it, must repeat the save.

**Symbol of Insanity Recharge 4-6**. Belial draws a magic symbol at a point he can see within 120 feet of him. All creatures within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the symbol must make a DC 25 Intelligence saving throw. Targets take 45 (10d8) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save immediately use their reaction to make a melee attack against a random creature within their reach, then move their full movement in a random direction.

##### Legendary Actions
**Ranseur**. Belial makes a Ranseur of Torture attack.

**Eruption (Costs 2 Actions)**. Belial causes molten stone to erupt from a point he can see within 90 feet of him. All creatures within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. Targets take 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Call Underling (Costs 3 Actions)**. Belial summons an allied [[horned devil]] in an unoccupied space that he can see.
