### Maw of Yeenoghu
_Huge fiend (demon), chaotic evil_

![[Maw of Yeenoghu.webp]]

Hill giants are known for their voracious appetites, which can attract the attention of the demon lord Yeenoghu, known as the Beast of Butchery. A cruel hill giant sometimes turns to Yeenoghu for help in expanding the reach of its malevolence. Occasionally a hill giant consumes an evil artifact that transforms the giant into a fiendish form. Once in a while, Yeenoghu whispers promises of power in the dreams of a giant whose hunger surpasses other giants'. In any case, the result is a ravenous monster called a maw of Yeenoghu, which is wholly devoted to the demon lord.

A maw of Yeenoghu grows a mane of hair and hunches over like a gnoll. Its jaw grows and widens, and its mouth fills with multiple rows of sharp teeth. These teeth constantly grow, driving the maw to bite and chew on anything within reach. Some maws desperately rip the teeth from their mouth for relief, but the teeth quickly regrow. Cunning maws use this phenomenon as a ready supply of weaponry, throwing clusters of teeth at their foes.

A maw of Yeenoghu charges at its prey on all fours with its mouth wide open, scraping the ground like a plow.

**Magic Resistance**. The maw has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The maw makes two Bite or Fang Fling attacks.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d12 + 6) piercing damage.

**Fang Fling**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d10 + 6) piercing damage.

**Gorging Charge Recharge 5-6**. The maw moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks and can move through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures. Each time the maw enters a creature's space for the first time during this move, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or take 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage and have the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16); if a creature is already [[grappled]] this way, it has the [[prone]] condition. Until this grapple ends, the target has the [[restrained]] condition. The maw can have only one creature [[grappled]] in this way at a time.

#### Reactions
**Fanged Rebuke**. In response to taking damage, the maw makes one Bite attack against a random creature within 10 feet of itself. If no creature is within reach, the maw can make two Fang Fling attacks.
