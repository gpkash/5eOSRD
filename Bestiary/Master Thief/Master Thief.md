### Master Thief
_Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment_

![[Master Thief.webp]]

Master thieves are known for perpetrating daring heists. They tend to develop a romanticized reputation. A master thief might "retire" from hands-on work to run a thieves' guild, spearhead some covert enterprise, or enjoy a quiet life of luxury.

When a master thief completes a challenging heist, they often leave behind a calling card to taunt their victims. You may roll on the Master Thief Calling Cards table to determine what a master thief leaves behind.

**Cunning Action**. On each of its turns, the thief can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Evasion**. If the thief is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the thief instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn)**. The thief deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the thief that isn't [[incapacitated]] and the thief doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The thief makes three attacks with its shortsword.

**Shortsword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

**Light Crossbow**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.

#### Reactions
**Uncanny Dodge**. The thief halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The thief must be able to see the attacker.
