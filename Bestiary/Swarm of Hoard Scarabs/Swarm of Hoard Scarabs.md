### Swarm of Hoard Scarabs
_Medium monstrosity, unaligned_

![[Swarm of Hoard Scarabs.jpg]]

Hoard scarabs are beetle-like creatures that, through some feat of natural adaptation or alchemical ingenuity, blend in perfectly among piles of gold coins. They feed on tiny mites that infest a dragon's scales and lair, and their painful bite can be a strong deterrent to would-be treasure thieves.

Hoard scarabs also produce a glittering metallic dust from their wings that coats intruders who get too close to them. The magic of this dust allows the lair's draconic owner to sense intruders' location as they move about the lair.

**False Appearance**. If the swarm is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the swarm move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the swarm is animate.

**Swarm**. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny scarab. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

##### Actions
**Swarm of Bites**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage if the swarm is at half of its hit points or fewer, and the target has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn.
