_Medium beast, _

![[Swarm of Maggots.webp]]

As nefarious powers grip an area, populations of maggots, scarabs, and similar scavenging insects explode and become aggressive predators.

**Swarm**. The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny maggot. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
