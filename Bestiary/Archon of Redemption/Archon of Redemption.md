### Archon of Redemption
_Large celestial, lawful neutral_

![[Archon of Redemption.webp]]

Like angels, archons are incarnations of white mana. They serve the archangels as embodiments of white mana's harsher aspects: a rigid sense of justice and a ruthless execution of punishment for those who defy the law. The appearance of the archons is deceptive: they look like hooded humans riding winged lions, but they are single creatures with just one mind and will.

An archon's game statistics are nearly identical to those of a [[deva]].

**Angelic Weapons**. The archon's weapon attacks are magical. When the archon hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).

**Axiomatic Mind**. The archon can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its understanding of justice.

**Magic Resistance**. The archon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**One Being**. Though it appears as a humanoid creature riding a mount, an archon is a single being. The "rider" can't be dismounted, and no other means can separate the two portions of the archon's being short of its death.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The archon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). The archon can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The archon makes two attacks: one with its sword and one with its claws.

**Sword**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) radiant damage.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) radiant damage.
