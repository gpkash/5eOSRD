### Swashbuckler
_Medium humanoid (any race), chaotic good evil_

![[Swashbuckler.webp]]

Swashbucklers are charming ne'er-do-wells who live by their own codes of honor. They crave notoriety, often indulge in romantic trysts, and eke out livings as pirates and corsairs, rarely staying in one place for too long.

Many swashbucklers have a signature flourish with which they embellish their actions to make themselves more memorable. You can roll on the Swashbuckler Flourishes table or choose one of the options to find a suitably dramatic flourish for a swashbuckler.
