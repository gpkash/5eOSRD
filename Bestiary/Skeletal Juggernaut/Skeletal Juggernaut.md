### Skeletal Juggernaut
_Large undead, lawful evil_

![[Skeletal Juggernaut token.png]]

As seen lumbering across the beaches in Isle of the Abbey, a skeletal juggernaut is an oversized, bipedal assembly of bones that loses a portion of its mass with each step. These skeletal guardians hold together for only a short time before disassembling into a gang of individual undead.

**Disassemble**. If the juggernaut is reduced to 0 hit points, twelve skeletons rise from its remains.

**Falling Apart**. If the juggernaut does not have all of its hit points at the start of its turn, it loses 10 hit points.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The juggernaut makes two claws attacks.

**Claws**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage.

**Avalanche of Bones Recharge 5-6**. The juggernaut collapses into a large heap before quickly reforming. Each creature within 10 feet of the juggernaut must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw is also knocked [[prone]].
