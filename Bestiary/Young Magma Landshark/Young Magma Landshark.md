**Searing Presence**. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the landshark takes 11 (2d10) fire damage.

**Standing Leap**. The landshark's [[long jump]] is up to 40 feet and its [[high jump]] is up to 20 feet, with or without a running start.

**Illumination**. The landshark sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.

##### Actions
**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (4d12 + 5) piercing damage, and 14 (4d6) fire damage.

**Deadly Leap**. If the landshark jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throws (target's choice) or be knocked [[prone]] and take 19 (4d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked [[prone]], and is pushed 5 feet out of the landshark's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls [[prone]] in the land-shark's space.
