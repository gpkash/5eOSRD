### Hippocamp
_Large monstrosity, chaotic good_

![[Hippocamp.webp]]

Noble steeds of the sea, hippocamps feature in countless tales as guides and mounts to tritons and other ocean-faring heroes. While these curious but cautious aquatic equines naturally travel in herds, many hold valued places in triton society. Considered to be servants of Thassa, hippocamps are often unpredictable, but their great speed and strength can prove awe-inspiring when harnessed by the god's will.
