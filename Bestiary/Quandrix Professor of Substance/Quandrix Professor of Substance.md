### Quandrix Professor of Substance
_Small, Medium humanoid (wizard), any alignment_

![[Quandrix Professor of Substance token.png]]

Professors of substance specialize in the concrete side of Quandrix philosophy, manipulating physical dimensions and properties of growth. Their magic alters and replaces the equations that describe the natural world, including creatures, space, and substance. Through these manipulations, the professors change their size and the physical form of others, manipulate nature into rapid growth, travel instantaneously, and even fold space into deadly edges.

These professors teach that numbers and mathematics aren't merely intellectual concepts, but that they exist physically in all things. Professors of substance teach their students to wield magic practically, creating tangible change in the world around them.


**Quandrix Scholars** The scholars of Quandrix College focus on the mathematical principles that govern reality. Through these formulas, they can manipulate properties of matter and space, as well as abstract and conceptual space such as the mind, probability, and the flow of magic itself.

**Spellcasting.** The professor casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The professor makes two Spatial Blade attacks.

**Spatial Blade**. _Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:_ +7 to hit (the target can't benefit from cover less than total cover), reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) force damage, or 22 (4d8 + 4) force damage if the professor is Large or larger, and the professor can push the target horizontally up to 10 feet away.

#### Reactions
**Avoidant Translation (2/Day)**. When the professor is hit by an attack roll, it can increase its AC by 3 against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The professor can then teleport, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
