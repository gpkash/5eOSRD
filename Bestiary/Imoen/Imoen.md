Imoen is a Bhaalspawn and the half-sister of Abdel Adrian. She was his first companion when he set out from Candlekeep after witnessing the murder of his mentor. Imoen is naturally inquisitive and her expertise in lockpicking and stealth ensures that no secret is ever safe from her.

During her adventures with Abdel, Imoen was captured by the wizard Jon Irenicus who experimented on her, hoping to unlock the powers she unknowingly had as a Bhaalspawn. Irenicus managed to extract Imoen's divine blood and transfuse it with his sibling Bodhi. While Imoen escaped her brush with death, she no longer had the powers of a Bhaalspawn and her blood was contaminated with a vampire's.

This contamination made several changes in Imoen. She has elongated incisors that she takes pains to conceal. Her aging process has slowed down, extending her life by centuries. Despite learning of her heritage and becoming infected with the blood of a vampire, Imoen has managed to retain a sunny outlook. However, her reputation in Baldur's Gate as the child of a god of murder eventually forced her to relocate south to the city of Athkatla, where she joined the Shadow Thieves.

In her new home city Imoen has embraced the fact that she is a fusion of god, human and vampire. She has become an expert in all of those who struggle with their identity. Imoen is friendly and easygoing but has no patience for wickedness—and she's not afraid to show it.

**Imoen as a Contact** Imoen becomes available as a contact for members of the Shadow Thieves at 7th level. Imoen has uncovered secrets of transformation that she is willing to share if asked. Imoen does require a donation for the poor and downtrodden of Athkatla and Baldur's Gate. She will cure someone already infected with lycanthropy for free, but this is not the same as showing them how to better control their changes.
