### Werebat
_Small humanoid (goblinoid, shapechanger), neutral evil_

![[Werebat.jpg]]

A werebat is a humanoid afflicted with a rare form of lycanthropy that enables it to transform into a giant bat or a bat-humanoid hybrid. (See the [[Monster Manual]] for more information on [[lycanthropy]].) Most werebats are of goblin stock.


**Deep Dwellers** Werebats are shunned even by goblin society because of their need to feed on blood to survive. They prefer to lair in dark places, such as attics and caves, and typically adopt nocturnal hunting habits.


**Blood Drinkers** A werebat must consume at least 1 pint of fresh blood each night, or it weakens and gains one level of [[exhaustion]] that no amount of rest alone can remove. Each pint of blood the werebat consumes removes one level of [[exhaustion]] gained in this fashion.


**Werebat Lycanthropy** A player character who becomes a werebat gains a Dexterity of 17 if their score isn't already higher. [[ Attack]] and damage rolls for the werebat's bite attack are based on the character's Strength or Dexterity score, whichever is higher.

**Shapechanger**. The werebat can use its action to polymorph into a Medium bat-humanoid hybrid, or into a Large giant bat, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Keen Hearing**. The werebat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

**Nimble Escape (Humanoid Form Only)**. The werebat can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.
