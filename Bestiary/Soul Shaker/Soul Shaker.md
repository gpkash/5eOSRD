### Soul Shaker
_Large undead, chaotic evil_

![[Soul Shaker.jpg]]

A grasping mass of Humanoid limbs, a soul shaker is an obsessive claimer of corpses and collector of body parts. These nightmarish creatures arise from ghoulish collections of severed limbs exposed to necromantic energies or when numerous crawling claws form a cooperative relationship.

Most of a soul shaker's victims have their vitality drained and their flesh pulverized by its many arms. However, should a soul shaker encounter someone with an impressionable mind, the creature attempts to charm the individual, using them as a lure to tempt others into its hunting grounds.

If defeated, a soul shaker disperses into several skittering, animate limbs. The terror can only truly be vanquished by destroying these disembodied appendages. If more than one of these pieces escape, the soul shaker reforms over the course of days and begins hunting once more.

**Enthralled Lure (1/Day)**. The soul shaker can cast the [[geas]] spell, requiring no spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12).

**Reconstruction**. When the soul shaker is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes into 7 ([[1d4 + 5) crawling claws. After 6 (1d12) days, if at least two of those crawling claws are alive, they teleport to the location of the soul shaker's death and merge together, whereupon the soul shaker reforms and regains all its hit points.

**Unusual Nature**. The soul shaker doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

##### Actions
**Crushing Grasp**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). The soul shaker can have only one creature [[grappled]] in this way at a time.
