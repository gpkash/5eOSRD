**Legendary Resistance (6/Day)**. If the scion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**. The scion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster**. The scion deals double damage to objects and structures.

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The scion makes one Crystal Club attack and two Slam attacks, then uses Entombing Grasp if available. Alternatively, the scion makes two Runic Boulder attacks.

**Crystal Club**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (4d12 + 9) bludgeoning damage. Hit or Miss: The scion can cause the club to flare with bright light, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (4d8) radiant damage and have the [[blinded]] condition until the start of the scion's next turn.

**Slam**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (4d10 + 9) force damage.

**Runic Boulder**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +16 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (4d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage. Hit or Miss: The boulder explodes. The target and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 19 (3d12) force damage and has the [[prone]] condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

**Entombing Grasp Recharge 6**. The scion wreathes its hand in petrifying magic and touches one Huge or smaller creature it can see within 20 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (8d6) force damage and have the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 19). At the start of the scion's next turn, if the target is still [[grappled]], the target has the [[petrified]] condition.
