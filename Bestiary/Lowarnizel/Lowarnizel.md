**Amphibious**. Lowarnizel can breathe both air and water.

**Spellcasting (Psionics).** Lowarnizel casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

##### Actions
**Multiattack**. Lowarnizel makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) force damage.

**Claw**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage.

**Singularity Breath Recharge 5-6**. Lowarnizel creates a shining bead of gravitational force, then releases the energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8) force damage, and its speed becomes 0 until the start of the dragon's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
