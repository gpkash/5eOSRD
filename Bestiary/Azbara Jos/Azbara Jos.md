**Potent Cantrips**. When Azbara casts an evocation Cantrips and misses, or the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target still takes half the cantrip's damage but suffers no other effect.

**Sculpt Spells**. When Azbara casts an evocation spell that affects other creatures that he can see, he can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level to succeed on their saving throws against the spell. Those creatures take no damage if they would normally take half damage from the spell.
