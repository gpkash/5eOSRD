### Mortlock Vanthampur
_Medium humanoid (human), lawful evil_

![[Mortlock Vanthampur.jpg]]

Mortlock is tolerated by his mother, Duke Thalamra Vanthampur, and despised by his older brothers, Thurstwell and Amrik, who view him as a simpleton and an abomination. Half of Mortlock's face was scarred by fire when he was a child, and his disfigurement gives him a fearsome countenance.
