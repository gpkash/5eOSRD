**Gythka**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d8 + 1) slashing damage.

**Psychic Bolt**. _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) psychic damage.

**Drain Vitality (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**. The thri-kreen targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself.
