### Living Doll
_Tiny construct, neutral evil_

![[Living Doll.webp]]

A living doll is easily mistaken for an inanimate doll or a stuffed animal until it moves. Trapped within each living doll is a mean spirit that encourages those around it to behave badly toward others. The doll takes pleasure in tormenting the guilt-ridden and despondent, hastening their descent into depression or paranoia. Because it fears its own destruction, the doll rarely causes direct harm to others. When forced to defend itself, it debilitates opponents with its maniacal cackle and assaults the minds of its enemies by turning their worst fears against them.

**False Appearance**. If the doll is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the doll move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the doll is animate.

**Regeneration**. The doll regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn. If the doll takes fire or psychic damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the doll's next turn. The doll is destroyed only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Unusual Nature**. The doll doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
