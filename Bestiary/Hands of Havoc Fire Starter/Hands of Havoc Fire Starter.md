##### Actions
**Multiattack**. The fire starter makes two Havoc Hammer or Havoc Flask attacks.

**Havoc Hammer**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage. If the target is a creature, magical flames cling to it, causing it to take 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target can make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

**Havoc Flask**. _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d12) fire damage. If the target is a creature, magical flames cling to it, causing it to take 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target can make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. After the fire starter throws the flask, roll a d6; on a 3 or lower, the fire starter has no more flasks to throw.
