### Nimblewright
_Medium construct, unaligned_

![[Nimblewright.jpg]]

A nimblewright is a magical construct created to serve as a guard or assassin. Composed predominantly of lightweight wood and powered by magic, it can pass for humanoid while wearing clothing. Some nimblewrights wear plain clothing, while others are clad in flashier attire. A nimblewright is emotionless, its face frozen in whatever expression was given to it by its creator.

**Duelist** A nimblewright moves like a dancer and fights like a swashbuckler, using dodges and parries to avoid damage while deftly skewering its foes.


**Constructed Nature** A nimblewright doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. Damage it takes can be repaired with [[mending]] spells, but a nimblewright reduced to 0 hit points is permanently destroyed.
