A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.



|             | **Good**         | **Neutral**         | **Evil**         |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Lawful**  | [[Lawful Good]]  | [[Lawful Neutral]]  | [[Lawful Evil]]  |
| **Neutral** | [[Neutral Good]] | [[Neutral]]         | [[Neutral Evil]] |
| **Chaotic** | [[Chaotic Good]] | [[Chaotic Neutral]] | [[Chaotic Evil]] |


## Alignment in the Multiverse

For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good- aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.

The evil [[deities]] who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god's influence.)

Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be [[lawful evil]], and it doesn't tend toward [[lawful evil]], but rather it is [[lawful evil]] in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be [[lawful evil]], it would cease to be a devil.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments-they are **unaligned**. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.
