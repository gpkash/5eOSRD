### Prodigy (XGE)

**Prerequisite:** [[Half-Elf]], [[half-orc]], [[human]]

You have a knack for learning new things. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain one skill proficiency of your choice, one tool proficiency of your choice, and fluency in one language of your choice.
- Choose one skill in which you have proficiency. You gain expertise with that skill, which means your [[proficiency bonus]] is doubled for any ability check you make with it. The skill you choose must be one that isn't already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your [[proficiency bonus]].
