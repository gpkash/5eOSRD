### Grudge Bearer

**Prerequisite:** [[Dwarf]]

You have a deep hatred for a particular kind of creature. Choose your foes, a type of creature to bear the burden of your wrath: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can choose two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs). You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your [[Strength]], [[Constitution]], or [[Wisdom]] score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- During the first round of any combat against your chosen foes, your attack rolls against any of them have advantage.
- When any of your chosen foes makes an opportunity attack against you, it makes the attack roll with disadvantage.
- Whenever you make an Intelligence ([[Arcana]], [[History]], [[Nature]], or [[Religion]]) check to recall information about your chosen foes, you add double your [[proficiency bonus]] to the check, even if youâ€™re not normally proficient.
