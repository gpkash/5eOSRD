### Drow High Magic (XGE)

**Prerequisite:** [[Elf]] (drow)

You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the _[[detect magic]]_ spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn _[[levitate]]_ and _[[dispel magic]]_, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a [[Long Rest]]. [[Charisma]] is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
