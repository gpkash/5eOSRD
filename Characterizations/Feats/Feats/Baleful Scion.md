You can channel cosmic forces of evil to gain these benefits:

- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- **Grasp of Avarice.** Once per turn, when you damage a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can also deal necrotic damage to it.
