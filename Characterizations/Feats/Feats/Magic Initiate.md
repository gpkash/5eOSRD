### Magic Initiate

Choose a class: [[bard]], [[Cleric]], [[Druid]], [[sorcerer]], [[Warlock]], or [[Wizard]]. You learn two cantrips of your choice from that class's spell list.

In addition, choose one 1st-level spell from that same list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast it, you must finish a [[Long Rest]] before you can cast it again.

Your spellcasting ability for these spells depends on the class you chose: [[Charisma]] for [[bard]], [[sorcerer]], or [[Warlock]]: [[Wisdom]] for [[Cleric]] or [[Druid]]; or [[Intelligence]] for [[Wizard]].
