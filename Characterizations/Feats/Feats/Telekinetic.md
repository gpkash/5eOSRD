### Telekinetic

You learn to move things with your mind. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your [[Intelligence]] score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You learn the _[[mage hand]]_ cantrip. You can cast it without verbal or somatic components, and you can make the spectral hand invisible.
- As a bonus action, you can try to shove one creature you can see within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by your _[[mage hand]]_ spell. When you do so, the target must succeed on a [[Strength]] saving throw (DC 8 + your [[proficiency bonus]] + your [[Intelligence]] modifier) or be pushed 5 feet away from you.
