### Martial Adept

You have martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:

- You learn two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype in the [[fighter]] class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your [[proficiency bonus]] + your [[Strength]] or [[Dexterity]] modifier (your choice).
- If you already have superiority dice, you gain one more; otherwise, you have one superiority die, which is a d6. This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or [[Long Rest]].
