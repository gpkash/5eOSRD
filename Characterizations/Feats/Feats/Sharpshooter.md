### Sharpshooter

You have mastered [[Ranged]] weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:

- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your [[Ranged]] weapon attack rolls.
- Your [[Ranged]] weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
- Before you make an attack with a [[Ranged]] weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.
