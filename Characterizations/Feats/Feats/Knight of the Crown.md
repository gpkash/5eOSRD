## Knight of the Crown

Prerequisite: 4th level, squire of solamnia feat

You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Crown, a group that extols the virtues of cooperation, loyalty, and obedience. You excel in group combat and gain these benefits:

- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- **Commanding Rally.** As a bonus action, you can command one ally within 30 feet of yourself to attack. If that ally can see or hear you, they can immediately make one weapon attack as a reaction. If the attack hits, the ally can roll a d8 and add the number rolled as a bonus to the attack's damage roll. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

> ##### Membership in Knightly Orders
>
>Knights of Solamnia are only ever members of one of their organization's orders. In the course of their training, most knights begin as members of the Knights of the Crown and then move on to join other orders. Whether a character follows this path or another, they retain what they learned as a member of an order even if they join another. Characters can change what knightly order they're a part of, but they always have access to any Knight of Solamnia feats they've acquired.
