### Critter Friend

**Prerequisite:** [[Gnome]] (Forest)

Your friendship with animals mystically deepens. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [[Animal Handling]] skill. If you’re already proficient in it, your [[proficiency bonus]] is doubled for any check you make with it.
- You learn the _[[speak with animals]]_ spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn the _[[animal friendship]]_ spell, and you can cast it once with this feat, without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a [[Long Rest]]. [[Intelligence]] is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
