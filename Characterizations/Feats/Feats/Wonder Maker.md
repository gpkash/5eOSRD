| Device             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Alarm**          | This device senses when a creature moves to within 15 feet of it without speaking aloud a password chosen when you create it. One round after a creature moves into range, the alarm makes a shrill ringing that lasts for 1 minute and can be heard from up to 300 feet away. |
| **Calculator**     | This device makes doing sums easy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Lifter**         | This device can be used as a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Adventuring Gear/Block and Tackle]], allowing its user to hoist five times the weight the user can normally lift.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Timekeeper**     | This pocket watch keeps accurate time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Weather Sensor** | When used as an action, this device predicts weather conditions in a 1-mile radius over the next 4 hours, showing one symbol (clouds, sun/moon, rain, or snow) for each hour.                                                                                                  |
