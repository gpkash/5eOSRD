## Keenness of the Stone Giant

Prerequisite: 4th level, strike of the giants (stone strike) feat

You've manifested the physical talents emblematic of stone giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength, Constitution, or Wisdom by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- **Cavernous Sight.** You gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from another source, its range increases by 60 feet.
- **Stone Throw.** As a bonus action, you can take a rock and make a magical attack with it. The attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 60 feet that uses the ability score you increased with this feat as the spellcasting ability. On a hit, the rock deals 1d10 force damage, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the spellcasting ability modifier) or have the prone condition. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
