### Elven Accuracy (XGE)

**Prerequisite:** [[Elf]], [[Half-Elf]]

The accuracy of elves is legendary, especially that of [[Elf]] archers and spellcasters. You have uncanny aim with attacks that rely on precision rather than brute force. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your [[Dexterity]], [[Intelligence]], [[Wisdom]], or [[Charisma]] by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Whenever you have advantage on an attack roll using [[Dexterity]], [[Intelligence]], [[Wisdom]], or [[Charisma]], you can reroll one of the dice once.
