### Defensive Duelist

**Prerequisite:** [[Dexterity]] 13 or higher

When you are wielding a [[Finesse]] weapon with which you are proficient and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your [[proficiency bonus]] to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.
