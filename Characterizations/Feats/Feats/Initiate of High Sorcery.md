## Initiate of High Sorcery

Prerequisite: Dragonlance Campaign, plus Sorcerer, Wizard, or Mage of High Sorcery

You've received training from magic-users affiliated with the Mages of High Sorcery.

Choose one of the three moons of Krynn to influence your magic: the black moon, Nuitari; the red moon, Lunitari; or the white moon, Solinari. You learn one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list and two 1st-level spells based on the moon you choose, as specified in the Lunar Spells table.

##### Lunar Spells
| Moon     | 1st-Level Spell                                                                                               |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nuitari  | Choose two from *dissonant whispers*, *false life*, *hex*, and *ray of sickness*                              |
| Lunitari | Choose two from *color spray*, *disguise self*, *feather fall*, and *longstrider*                             |
| Solinari | Choose two from *comprehend languages*, *detect evil and good*, *protection from evil and good*, and *shield* |

You can cast each of the chosen 1st-level spells without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast them in this way again. You can also cast the spells using any spell slots you have.

Your spellcasting ability for this feat's spells is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).
