### Wood Elf Magic (XGE)

**Prerequisite:** [[Elf]] (wood)

You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people. You learn one [[Druid]] cantrip of your choice. You also learn the _[[longstrider]]_ and _[[pass without trace]]_ spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a [[Long Rest]]. [[Wisdom]] is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
