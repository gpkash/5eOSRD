### Second Change (XGE)

**Prerequisite:** [[Halfling]]

Fortune favors you when someone tries to strike you. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your [[Dexterity]], [[Constitution]], or [[Charisma]] by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force that creature to re-roll. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you roll initiative at the start of combat or until you finish a short or [[Long Rest]].
