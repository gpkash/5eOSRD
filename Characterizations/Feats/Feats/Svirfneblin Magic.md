### Svirfneblin Magic

**Prerequisite:** [[Gnome]] (Deep)

You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast [[Nondetection]] on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [[Blindness-Deafness|blindness/deafness]], [[blur]], and [[disguise self]]. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a [[Long Rest]]. [[Intelligence]] is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you cast them at their lowest possible levels.
