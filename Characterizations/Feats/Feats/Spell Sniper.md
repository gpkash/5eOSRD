### Spell Sniper

**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast at least one spell

You have learned techniques to enhance your attacks with certain kinds of spells, gaining the following benefits:

- When you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll, the spell's range is doubled.
- Your [[Ranged]] spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
- You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll. Choose the cantrip from the [[bard]], [[Cleric]]. [[Druid]], [[Sorcerer]], [[Warlock]], or [[Wizard]] spell list. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip depends on the spell list you chose from: [[Charisma]] for [[bard]], [[Sorcerer]], or [[Warlock]]; [[Wisdom]] for [[Cleric]] or [[Druid]]; or [[Intelligence]] for [[Wizard]].
