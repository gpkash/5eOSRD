### Diehard (homebrew)

You may die one day - but it will not be **this** day. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your [[Constitution]] score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you roll a death saving throw, a result of 1 counts as only one failure. Additionally, if you roll a 20 which would be your first success, you become stable. If you roll a 20 as your second or third success, you regain 1 hit point.
