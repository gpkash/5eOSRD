### Dagger Master (homebrew)

You've always had an uncanny affinity to [[Finesse]] blades, and daggers are the focus of your practice. Countless hours of training have elevated your skill with the blade to levels of mastery few others could ever hope to achieve.

- You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with daggers and [[Finesse]] weapons.
- When making a [[Ranged]] attack with a dagger, attacking at long range does not impose disadvantage on your [[Ranged]] weapon attack roll.
- Your unparalleled precision enables you to deal 1d6, (instead of 1d4), points of damage, when making attacks with daggers. Additionally, when making a melee attack with a dagger, you can choose to deal piercing or slashing damage.
