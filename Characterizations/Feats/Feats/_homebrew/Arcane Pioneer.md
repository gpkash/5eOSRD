### Arcane Pioneer (homebrew)

**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast at least one spell

Your study of the arcane arts has given you [[insight]] into the shaping of magical energies.

When you cast a spell that deals fire, cold, lightning, thunder, or force damage, you can use a Bonus Action to change the type of damage into another one of those forms.

Per [[Long Rest]], you can use this ability a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
