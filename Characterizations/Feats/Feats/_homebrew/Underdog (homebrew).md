 ### Underdog (homebrew)

When the going gets tough, that's when you get going. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your [[Constitution]] score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When a creature scores a critical hit against you, you have advantage on the next attack you make against that creature, until the end of your next turn.
- If a critical hit against you drops you to 0 hit points, you drop instead to 1 hit point.
