### Acrobat (homebrew)

You're extraordinary agile and dexterous and can bend, contort and control your body in ways that almost seem inhuman.

- Your [[Dexterity]] Score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency in the [[Acrobatics]] skill. If you are already proficient in it, you double your proficiency.
- Once per [[Short Rest]], you can reroll a failed Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check; you must use the new result.
