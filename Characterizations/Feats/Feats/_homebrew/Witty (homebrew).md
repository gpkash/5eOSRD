    ### Witty (homebrew)

The force of your personality may go unnoticed at first, but in practice others rarely make you do anything you wouldn't want to do. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your [[Charisma]] score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When you would make a [[Wisdom]] saving throw, you can choose to make a [[Charisma]] saving throw instead. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier per day.
