### Bulwark (homebrew)

No matter what, you **will** hold your ground. You gain the following benefits:

- At the start of your next turn, you can reduce your speed to 0. If you do so, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the next melee attack against you, before the start of your next turn.
- When an effect causes you to move without expending your movement, you can choose to move half the distance instead, unless that effect also knocks you [[prone]] or into the air.
