### Escape Artist (homebrew)

You are adept at slipping out of other creatures' grasps. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain advantage on rolls to avoid becoming [[grappled]] by a creature.
- When you escape a creature's grapple on your turn, you can immediately use a bonus action to move up to half of your speed away from the creature.
- If you would add your [[proficiency bonus]] to an ability check made to end the [[grappled]] or [[restrained]] condition on yourself, you can instead add twice your [[proficiency bonus]].
