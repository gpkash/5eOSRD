### Focused Caster (homebrew)

You have mastered your ability to concentrate even under duress. You gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on checks to maintain concentration.
- When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you may double its duration.
- When you fail a concentration check, that spell lasts for 1d2 extra rounds. You may use this feature only once per [[Long Rest]].
