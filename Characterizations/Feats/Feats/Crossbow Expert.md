### Crossbow Expert

Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:

- You ignore the [[Loading]] quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your [[Ranged]] attack rolls.
- When you use the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a loaded hand crossbow you are holding.
