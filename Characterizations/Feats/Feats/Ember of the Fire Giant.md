## Ember of the Fire Giant

Prerequisite: 4th level, strike of the giants (fire strike) feat

You've manifested the fiery combat emblematic of fire giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength, Constitution, or Wisdom by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- **Born of Flame.** You have resistance to fire damage.
- **Searing Ignition.** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace a single attack with a magical burst of flame. Each creature of your choice in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the ability increased by this feat). On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to 1d8 + your proficiency bonus, and it has the blinded condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. You can use your Searing Ignition a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus (but no more than once per turn), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
