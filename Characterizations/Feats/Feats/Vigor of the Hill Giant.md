## Vigor of the Hill Giant

Prerequisite: 4th level, strike of the giants (hill strike) feat

You've manifested the resilience emblematic of hill giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength, Constitution, or Wisdom by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- **Bulwark.** When you are subjected to an effect that would move you at least 5 feet or give you the prone condition, you can use your reaction to steady yourself. You aren't moved and don't have the prone condition.
