### Grappler

**Prerequisite:** [[Strength]] 13 or higher

You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.
- You can use your action to try to pin a creature [[grappled]] by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both [[restrained]] until the grapple ends.
- Creatures that are one size larger than you don't automatically succeed on checks to escape your grapple.
