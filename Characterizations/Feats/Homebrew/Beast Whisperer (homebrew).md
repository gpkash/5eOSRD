### Beast Whisperer (homebrew)

**Prerequisite:** Proficiency in [[Animal Handling]]

You are attuned to the feelings of all creatures. As a result, you gain the following benefits:

- Increase your [[Wisdom]] score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Your [[proficiency bonus]] is doubled for any checks using [[Animal Handling]].
- As an action, you may attempt to charm a beast within 30 feet that you can see or hear. The beast must make a [[Wisdom]] saving throw against a DC of 8 + your [[proficiency bonus]] + your [[Wisdom]] modifier. The charm lasts for a number of minutes equal to your proficiency modifier.
