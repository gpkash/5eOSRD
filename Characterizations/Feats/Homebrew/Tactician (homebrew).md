### Tactician (homebrew)

You use your mind as well as your speed when entering combat. You gain the following benefits:

- You may use your [[Intelligence]] or [[Wisdom]] modifier in place of your [[Dexterity]] modifier when rolling initiative.
- When you roll initiative, you can choose one willing creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you, and swap initiative results.
