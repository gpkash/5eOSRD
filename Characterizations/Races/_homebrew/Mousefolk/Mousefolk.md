# Mousefolk

![[image-000.jpg]]

> *Obscured in the thick underbrush of the forest, every muscle in Moira's body was screaming. She had been crouched, completely still, for half a day, waiting for her quarry to emerge from its den. Thick mud clumped and matted her dark fur, insulating her from the high sun. Her large round ears twitched, focusing on a faint scratching coming from the cave. Her prey was awake. Moira drew her bow and deftly nocked an arrow without a sound. She waited.*

Soon the mighty owlbear lumbered out of the cave. A dry summer had forced it closer to civilization, and it had begun preying on trade caravans. Moira took aim, and let fly her arrow.

The Barbed Trail would be safe to travel once more.

The life of the Mousefolk is one spent close to the ground. With no great empires or kingdoms to call home, the Mousefolk spend their lives carving a place for themselves in the cities of the larger races or in the untamed wilds. They form tight-knit communities where every member is expected to contribute to the success of the whole. Some Mousefolk study a trade skill to support their families, while others use their natural agility and intellect for contract services.

## Furry And Nimble

Reaching an little over 2 feet tall, the Mousefolk often go unnoticed in their day to day activities.

Their diminutive stature and quiet demeanour make the Mousefolk inoffensive to most, granting a certain detachment from the major conflicts and strife of the age. Their fast metabolisms and quick feet give the Mousefolk a slender build, usually weighing between 20-30 pounds.

Mousefolk fur color ranges from white to tan to brown or black, with various patterns passed through heredity. They take care to groom and clean their fur, as it represents their family and community. A Mousefolk's eye color is either red or black. Mousefolk like to wear comfortable dark colored clothes that allow for discretion and a wide range of movement.

The concept of personal wealth or glory doesn't pervade through Mousefolk culture, most actions taken are for the good of the community rather than the self. Any wealth or resources gained are utilized for the betterment of the group. Some Mousefolk, however, use their natural abilities for personal gain. These individuals tend to be outcasts or black sheep of the clans.

## Home and Hearth

The Mousefolk are a resourceful and tenacious race. Mousefolk settlements can be found in the most unlikely and inhospitable of places.

They tend to build homes in the dark shadows and forgotten corners of the world, such as city slums, deep forests, scorching deserts, arctic tundras, or port cities in exotic lands. The Mousefolk aren't typically farmers, instead preferring hunting, trade, and craft to meet their needs. Mousefolk caravans are not an easy target for bandits, guarded by skilled archers within and a bristling wall of oak and steel without.

Mousefolk families extend beyond blood ties, an individual's entire community is treated as kin. Mousefolk settlers will seek out other colonies, and new warrens will arise within close proximity to each other. These communities will eventually grow and merge, the members of each becoming kin to the other.

## Artisans and Adventurers

The Mousefolk have a deep love of art, literature, song, and craft, and will often spend a lifetime perfecting their trade. True masterworks are rarely seen by the outside world, instead they are preserved and passed through the generations. To be a keeper of lore and heritage is among the highest honors and greatest responsibilities in Mousefolk culture.

The Mousefolk who do not end up learning a trade will often put their skills to use pursuing esoteric knowledge, training as defenders, spiritual leaders, rangers, covert agents, or they might even travel the world as an adventurer-for-hire.

### Virtuous and Headstrong

Despite their generally flighty appearance, mousefolk are a very honorable people. They believe strongly in personal honor, less so in the idea that the actions of others can impugn that honor. When a mousefolk makes a mistake, especially one that causes harm to others, they will work hard and at long lengths to correct that mistake.

## Mousefolk Names

When a Mousefolk is old enough to read, they are taken by an elder to the clan's archives to study the lore and histories of their people. After several years, the individual is allowed to pick their own name, either adopting the name of a past hero, or inventing a new name for themselves.
