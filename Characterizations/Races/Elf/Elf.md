# Elf

### Elf Traits

Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

***Ability Score Increase***. Your [[Dexterity]] score increases by 2.

***Age***. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

***Alignment***. Elves love freedom, variety, and self- expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.

***Size***. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed***. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

## High Elf

As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.

***Ability Score Increase***. Your [[Intelligence]] score increases by 1.

- [[Elf Weapon Training]]

***Cantrip***. You know one cantrip of your choice from the [[wizard spells]]. [[Intelligence]] is your spellcasting ability for it.

***Extra Language***. You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.


## Wood Elf

As a wood elf, you have [[keen senses]] and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faer√ªn, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.

Wood elves' skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your [[Wisdom]] score increases by 1.

## Dark Elf (Drow)

Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess [[Lolth]] down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.

Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your [[Charisma]] score increases by 1.

- [[Superior Darkvision]]
- [[Sunlight Sensitivity]]

***Drow Magic.*** You know the [[dancing lights]] cantrip.

When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [[faerie fire]] spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the [[darkness]] spell once per day. [[Charisma]] is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

***Drow Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.
