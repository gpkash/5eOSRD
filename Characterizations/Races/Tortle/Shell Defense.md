#### [[Tortle]] Race Feature: Shell Defense

**Shell Defense.** You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on [[Strength]] and [[Constitution]] saving throws. While in your shell, you are [[prone]], your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on [[Dexterity]] saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.
