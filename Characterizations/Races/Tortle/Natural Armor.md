#### [[Tortle]] Race Feature: Natural Armor

**Natural Armor.** Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your [[Dexterity]] modifier doesn't affect this number). You can't wear [[light armor]], [[medium armor]], or [[heavy armor]], but if you are using a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Armor/Shield|shield]], you can apply the [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Armor/Shield|shield]]'s bonus as normal.
