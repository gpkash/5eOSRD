# Chosen of Mystra

Chosen of [[Mystra]] appears very rarely, only when the Mother of All Magic herself gifts over a connection to the Weave that only those with her blessing can match. They wield the fabled silver fire in their grasp.

### Maker of Magic
Beginning at 2nd level the gold and time you must spend to write spells into your spellbook, craft spell scrolls and enchant magical items is halved.

### Spellsight
Starting at 3rd level, your link to the Weave has improved beyond normal limits, providing you insight and minor influence into and over the Weave itself. You can now identify arcane spells during their casting.

Twice per [[Long Rest]], you can use your Reaction to delay the casting of a spell you can see within 60 feet of you until the end of the round.

### Connection to the Weave
Your connection to the weave is enhanced. Starting at 4th level, your link to the Weave deepens, providing you to see the weave in everyday mundane objects. Any object containing magical properties will show a concentration of weave.

Once per [[Long Rest]] you can [[Detect Magic]].

### Arcane Resilience
Starting at 6th level, you have grown accustomed to using the Weave to defend yourself from even the deadliest of magics, making you naturally resilient to elemental types of magic.

Choose two types of damage from the following list: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, radiant, and thunder. You have [[5eOSRD/Gameplay/Combat/Resistence/Resistance|resistance]] against spell damage from these two types. Furthermore, you have advantage on saving throws against spells that deal damage of either of the selected types.

### Knowledge of the Weave
Starting at 10th level, you are able to gain knowledge through the weave and listen to it's intention.

Once per [[Long Rest]] you can cast [[Identify]].

### Silverfire
Starting at 14th level, twice per [[Long Rest]], you can use an action to conjure four magical heatless, silver fire sparks that last 1 minute. They spin around you providing you with protection. As long as one remains enemies roll disadvantage on attacks against you. They immediately dissipate if you are [[incapacitated]] or until you use an action to quench them. You cannot transfer this protection to others. Once conjured, during your turn, you may use an action to do one of the following:

- Launch 1 or more sparks into silver fire magic missiles dealing 4d4 damage each.
- Turn 1 or more into a [[continual flame]] (without components) at 3rd level.
- Launch 1 or more sparks to ignite a 5-foot square area with silver fire for 1 minute. Any creature who touches the space instantly take 1d12 damage and any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

### Becoming the Weave
Starting at 17th level, your mind and body begin to merge with the weave. 

You are immune to poison, do no longer need to breath, eat, drink or sleep. You do not suffer from aging effects and you cannot be magically aged.
