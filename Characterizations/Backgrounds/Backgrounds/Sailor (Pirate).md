## Sailor (Pirate)

You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and savages. You've indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you've garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.

If you decide that your sailing career involved piracy, you can choose the Bad Reputation feature instead of the Ship's Passage feature.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Navigator's tools*, vehicles (water)
- **Equipment:** A belaying pin (*club*), *silk rope (50 feet)*, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random *trinket* on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Bad Reputation

No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.

|  1  | My friends know they can rely on me, no matter what.                        |
|  2  | I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.                  |
|  3  | I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale. |
|  4  | I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.                           |
|  5  | To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.              |
|  6  | I never pass up a friendly wager.                                           |
|  7  | My language is as foul as an otyugh nest.                                   |

|  1  | Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. (Good) |
|  2  | Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful)                           |
|  3  | Freedom. The sea is freedom—the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)                |
|  4  | Mastery. I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil)                      |
|  5  | People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral)                                  |

|  1  | I'm loyal to my captain first, everything else second.                                                              |
|  2  | The ship is most important—crewmates and captains come and go.                                                      |
|  3  | I'll always remember my first ship.                                                                                 |
|  4  | In a harbor town, I have a paramour whose eyes nearly stole me from the sea.                                        |
|  5  | I was cheated out of my fair share of the profits, and I want to get my due.                                        |
|  6  | Ruthless pirates murdered my captain and crewmates, plundered our ship, and left me to die. Vengeance will be mine. |

|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I follow orders, even if I think they're wrong.                                             |
|  2  | I'll say anything to avoid having to do extra work.                                         |
|  3  | Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation. |
|  4  | Once I start drinking, it's hard for me to stop.                                            |
|  5  | I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across.                       |
|  6  | My pride will probably lead to my destruction.                                              |
