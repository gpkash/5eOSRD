You've dedicated your life to studying runecraft. Whether you were taught by a master rune carver or learned by poring over ancient engravings, you can tap into the supernatural power held within runes.
The art of runecraft was initially created by giants, but over time, the practice has been adopted by many peoples. As such, though Giant runes are the most commonly used, many rune carvers incorporate symbols from their native languages into the craft.

|  1  | Is it practical to learn an ancient language that is rarely spoken? No. But is it fun? Very.                                                             |
|  2  | I learned one of my ancestors was a lauded rune carver whose story was lost to time. I seek to rekindle that legacy.                                     |
|  3  | The old, traditional markings of runecraft look so boring. Why not give my runes some flair?                                                             |
|  4  | In my studies of runes, I strive to understand how great civilizations of the past fell, so I can prevent it from happening to societies of the present. |
|  5  | Life may be a whirlwind of chaos, but whenever I create my runes, I feel at peace.                                                                       |
|  6  | My brain struggles to process words written in ink, but the feeling of carved runes makes my mind sing.                                                  |
