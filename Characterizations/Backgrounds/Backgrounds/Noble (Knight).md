## Noble (Knight)

A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).

As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart–in a chaste sort of devotion. (This person could be your bond.)

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes*, a *signet ring*, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp

#### Feature: Retainers

You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. **One of your retainers is a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood** (This person could be your bond.). Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).

Your retainers can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.
