## Baldur's Gate Hermit

While some might think it strange to find hermits in a bustling city, others know that sometimes the most profound solitude exists in the midst of a crowd. Baldur's Gate holds a handful of souls who manage to find isolation amid its tumult.

#### Feature: Discovery

The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.

Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: The Real City

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You know the Baldur's Gate most Baldurians ignore, the dog-eat-dog world of the homeless and unfortunate. You know where to go in the Lower City and Outer City for anonymity. In these slums and alley camps, you can get a damp bed and a bad meal, but also a degree of privacy and no questions asked. Living here isn't comfortable, but it's unlikely anyone will find you—and you can stay as long as you want.

#### Hermit Origins

Any number of personal choices or ill-fated circumstances might have led you to turn away from society. You may, if you wish, choose or roll an origin event from the Hermit Origins table.

|  d6 | Origin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | You led an ill-fated expedition into the Riverveins. Your friends were swept away by flooding, and you've never been able to shake the guilt of causing their deaths over a frivolous lark. You've maintained a solitary vigil outside the cavern entrance ever since.                                                                                      |
|  2  | You crossed the Guild in a bad way. Fortunately, its members think you're dead. Less fortunately, maintaining that deception might require you to stay in hiding until you actually are.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  3  | You study the puzzles of mortal natures. You've seen followers of evil deities perform miracles for the helpless at Twin Songs, and you've seen patriars who worship good deities turn their backs on the poor daily. Bearing witness to such things, and meditating on their contradictions, fills your hours.                                             |
|  4  | You tend to some part of the city's forgotten history: the unmarked graves in Cliffside Cemetery, the crumbling remains of dead patriar families' manors, or a collection of religious texts stuffed into an attic and forgotten when a believer's patron deity died. In this solitary work, you've learned secrets no one else knows.                      |
|  5  | You killed a patriar's scion in an illegal duel. The family swore revenge, and you fled to the slums rather than risk bringing their wrath down on your kin.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  6  | You aren't originally from Baldur's Gate. You came here seeking something else, only to learn that the quest that drove you had become impossible to fulfill—its object was destroyed or its purpose was negated by some superseding event. Suddenly directionless and unable to return to your homeland, you have lingered, adrift, in this wretched city. |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.

|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I've been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt.         |
|  2  | I am utterly serene, even in the face of disaster.                                                        |
|  3  | The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic, and I am eager to share that wisdom. |
|  4  | I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer.                                                             |
|  5  | I'm oblivious to etiquette and social expectations.                                                       |

|  7  | I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings.             |
|  8  | I am working on a grand philosophical theory and love sharing my ideas.                                   |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                                                 |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Greater Good. My gifts are meant to be shared with all, not used for my own benefit. (Good)           |
|  2  | Logic. Emotions must not cloud our sense of what is right and true, or our logical thinking. (Lawful) |
|  3  | Free Thinking. Inquiry and curiosity are the pillars of progress. (Chaotic)                           |
|  4  | Power. Solitude and contemplation are paths toward mystical or magical power. (Evil)                  |
|  5  | Live and Let Live. Meddling in the affairs of others only causes trouble. (Neutral)                   |

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Nothing is more important than the other members of my hermitage, order, or association.               |
|  2  | I entered seclusion to hide from the ones who might still be hunting me. I must someday confront them. |
|  3  | I'm still seeking the enlightenment I pursued in my seclusion, and it still eludes me.                 |
|  4  | I entered seclusion because I loved someone I could not have.                                          |
|  5  | Should my discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.                                   |
|  6  | My isolation gave me great insight into a great evil that only I can destroy.                          |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                   |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Now that I've returned to the world, I enjoy its delights a little too much.           |
|  2  | I harbor dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation and meditation failed to quell. |
|  3  | I am dogmatic in my thoughts and philosophy.                                           |
|  4  | I let my need to win arguments overshadow friendships and harmony.                     |
|  5  | I'd risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge.                                  |
|  6  | I like keeping secrets and won't share them with anyone.                               |
