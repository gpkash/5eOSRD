## Variant Entertainer (Gladiator)

A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus performer, trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd can enjoy. This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your By Popular Demand feature, you can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment–perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club. You can replace the musical instrument in your equipment package with an inexpensive but unusual weapon, such as a trident or net.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Acrobatics, Performance
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Disguise kit*, one type of musical instrument
- **Equipment:** An inexpensive but unusual weapon, such as a *trident* or *net* (one of your choice), the favor of an admirer (love letter, lock of hair, or trinket), *costume clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: By Popular Demand

You can always find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment—perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.
