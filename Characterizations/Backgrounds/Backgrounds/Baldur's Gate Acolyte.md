## Baldur's Gate Acolyte

It's said that every faith in the world has a believer in Baldur's Gate. Not only are most established faiths tolerated—even if some of them, including most of the openly evil faiths, are relegated to the Outer City's Twin Songs neighborhood—but new ones arrive constantly, carried by travelers and proselytizers from far-flung lands. A character with this background might aspire to greater things, not for themselves, but for their faith.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *holy symbol* (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer *book* or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful

As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Religious Community

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You're tightly connected with the religious community of Baldur's Gate. You know if a deity has a following in the city and any places that faith openly congregates and the neighborhoods those faithful typically inhabit. While this isn't remarkable for most of the city's larger faiths, keeping track of the hundreds of religions newcomers bring with them is no mean feat.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

|  1  | I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.              |
|  2  | I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic.     |
