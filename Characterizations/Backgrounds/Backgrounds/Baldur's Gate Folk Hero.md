## Baldur's Gate Folk Hero

Baldur's Gate is a city badly in need of heroes, and every so often, one rises from among its own. Ordinary people who rise to greatness are beloved in local history, but the popular imagination can turn on such champions almost as quickly as it anoints them.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Animal Handling, Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools, vehicles (land)

#### Feature: Rustic Hospitality

Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Social Vengeance

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You've lived your entire life in the Lower or Outer City of Baldur's Gate. You grew up seeing arrogant patriars flaunt their wealth while your hardworking neighbors struggled. As a result, you know how eager commoners in Baldur's Gate are to see any patriar get what they deserve. While in a busy part of the Lower City or Outer City of Baldur's Gate, you can spend 2d10 minutes to convince 1d6 **commoners** to perform a non-illegal act that inconveniences a member of the Watch or Flaming Fist, a patriar, or some other wealthy looking individual.

|  1  | You helped get healing for a sick child. Now the sick come to you, knowing you'll help them find a way to salvation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  2  | You helped break a Guild protection racket afflicting a community of immigrants in the Outer City. Now, you can't travel through that part of the city without your dozen adopted grandparents inviting you in for a meal.                                                                                                                |
|  3  | Seeing a lost patriar after dark in the Outer City, you guided the wayward noble through back streets to safety. The patriar repaid your help by paying for improved roofs and lamps in your neighborhood, causing the entire community to celebrate your deed.                                                                           |
|  4  | Fueled by alcohol, you faced down a carrion crawler that slunk out of the sewer, knocking it out with a single punch. Since then, however, the ale you once credited with your heroism has drowned it, and even your most patient admirers are losing hope. You're hoping for one last chance to win back the goodwill you've drunk away. |
|  5  | You once defeated a raging bugbear with a hand mirror, a mounted deer's head, and two kicks to the groin. Later, you and the bugbear became friends.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  6  | Last winter, you dove into the frigid river to haul out a foundering fishing boat with your bare hands, saving all aboard. Now, everyone on the docks knows your name.                                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Suggested Characteristics

A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities remain very important to them.

|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I judge people by their actions, not their words.                                                   |
|  2  | If someone is in trouble, I'm always ready to lend help.                                            |
|  3  | When I set my mind to something, I follow through no matter what gets in my way.                    |
|  4  | I have a strong sense of fair play and always try to find the most equitable solution to arguments. |
|  5  | I'm confident in my own abilities and do what I can to instill confidence in others.                |
|  6  | Thinking is for other people. I prefer action.                                                      |
|  7  | I misuse long words in an attempt to sound smarter.                                                 |

|  5  | Secretly, I believe that things would be better if I were a tyrant lording over the land.              |
