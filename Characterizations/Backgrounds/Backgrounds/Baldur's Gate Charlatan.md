## Baldur's Gate Charlatan

Everybody's always trying to get a leg up on somebody in Baldur's Gate. One group's con artist might be another's revolutionary. Or maybe you're just in it for yourself. In any case, characters with this background have a plan to hit the big time; all they need is audacity and a little time.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Disguise kit*, *Forgery kit*
- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes*, a *disguise kit*, tools of the con of your choice (ten stoppered bottles filled with colored liquid, a set of weighted dice, a deck of marked cards, or a signet ring of an imaginary duke), and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: False Identity

You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.

#### Baldur's Gate Feature: Long-Lost Heir

*The effects of a Baldur's Gate feature can be used only while the character is in Baldur's Gate—though, at the DM's discretion, they might have applicable effects in situations similar to those in Baldur's Gate.*

You're well-versed in the mannerisms and idiosyncrasies of Baldurian patriars and other nobles, imitating them smoothly enough to convince even the snootiest family heads of your authenticity. You're skilled at posing as the long-lost heir to some imaginary or extinguished patriar lineage.

Because of your skill in passing yourself off as a patriar, you have a Watch token that allows you alone into the Upper City of Baldur's Gate. You might be able to bluff others through with you, or even convince members of the Watch that you're a patriar. However, any true test of your authenticity is likely to reveal your deception.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Charlatans are colorful characters who conceal their true selves behind the masks they construct. They reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues.

|  1  | Independence. I am a free spirit—no one tells me what to do. (Chaotic)             |
|  2  | Fairness. I never target people who can't afford to lose a few coins. (Lawful)     |

|  1  | I fleeced the wrong person and must work to ensure that this individual never crosses paths with me or those I care about.       |
|  2  | I owe everything to my mentor—a horrible person who's probably rotting in jail somewhere.                                        |

|  5  | A powerful person killed someone I love. Some day soon, I'll have my revenge.                                                    |
|  6  | I swindled and ruined a person who didn't deserve it. I seek to atone for my misdeeds but might never be able to forgive myself. |

|  2  | I'm always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in.              |
|  3  | I'm convinced that no one could ever fool me the way I fool others.                                            |

|  5  | I can't resist swindling people who are more powerful than me.                                                 |
|  6  | I hate to admit it and will hate myself for it, but I'll run and preserve my own hide if the going gets tough. |
