## Rakdos Cultist

You're an entertainer at heart, a performer with a flair for the dramatic and a love of the spotlight. You've spent years honing your craft, mastering a demanding set of skills so you can perform them with panache and make them look easy. The wild applause, the screams of the crowds, the mayhem and terror spreading into the streets—this is what you live for.

You're also a member of a cult devoted to an ancient demon who delights in violence and chaos. It just so happens that Rakdos loves a good show, and your highest aspiration is to please the Defiler, the Lord of Riots, with your own performance.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Acrobatics, Performance
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument
- **Languages:** Choose either Abyssal or Giant
- **Equipment:** A Rakdos insignia, a musical instrument (one of your choice), a *costume*, a *hooded lantern* made of wrought iron, a 10-foot length of chain with sharply spiked links, a *tinderbox*, 10 *torches*, a set of *common clothes*, a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp (a mix of Azorius and Boros 1-zino coins), and a bottle of sweet, red juice

#### A Flair for the Dramatic

Rakdos performance styles typically fuse standard circus-style acrobatics with fire, wrought-iron spikes and hooks, and monsters. You can roll a d8 or choose from the options in the Performance Options table to determine your preferred style of performance.

##### Performance Options
|  d8 | Type of Performer    |
|:---:|----------------------|
|  1  | Spikewheel acrobat   |
|  2  | Lampooning satirist  |
|  3  | Fire juggler         |
|  4  | Marionette puppeteer |
|  5  | Pain artist          |
|  6  | Noise musician       |
|  7  | Nightmare clown      |
|  8  | Master of ceremonies |

#### Feature: Fearsome Reputation

People recognize you as a member of the Cult of Rakdos, and they're careful not to draw your anger or ridicule. You can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a restaurant or breaking down a door at a local shop, if no legal authorities witness the crime. Most people are too daunted by you to report your wrongdoing to the Azorius.

#### Rakdos Guild Spells

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature*

For you, the spells on the Rakdos Guild Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class. (If you are a multiclass character with multiple spell lists, these spells are added to all of them.)

##### Rakdos Guild Spells
| Spell Level | Spells                                                  |
|:-----------:|---------------------------------------------------------|
|   Cantrip   | *fire bolt*, *vicious mockery*                          |
|     1st     | *burning hands*, *dissonant whispers*, *hellish rebuke* |
|     2nd     | *crown of madness*, *enthrall*, *flaming sphere*        |
|     3rd     | *fear*, *haste*                                         |
|     4th     | *confusion*, *wall of fire*                             |
|     5th     | *dominate person*                                       |

Your magic often produces a flashy spectacle, wreathing you or your targets in a mixture of harmless flame and shadowy shapes. When you manipulate an opponent's mind, a flaming symbol of Rakdos might momentarily appear like a mask over the target's face.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Members of demonic cults aren't generally known as the kindest or most mentally stable individuals, so you're likely to have something in your nature that distinguishes you from the law-abiding citizens of Ravnica.

|  3  | Everything is funny to me, and the most hilarious and bloodiest things leave me cackling with sadistic glee. |
|  4  | I derive genuine pleasure from the pain of others.                                                           |

|  3  | I'm secretly hoping that I can change the cult from the inside, using my influence to help rein in the wanton violence. |

|  6  | There's no such thing as too much pleasure.                                                        |

#### Contacts

The Cult of Rakdos is anything but organized. Individuals frequently move from one performance troupe to another. Almost all members of the cult know former castmates now in different troupes, which allows for the possibility of a widespread network of contacts.

Roll twice on the Rakdos Contacts table (for an ally and a rival) and once on the Non-Rakdos Contacts table.

##### Rakdos Contacts

#### How Do I Fit In?

The Cult of Rakdos encourages independent action on the part of its members. Its goal is fomenting chaos, and it firmly believes in putting its own house in disorder before carrying that mission into the larger city. So your role is to execute your vision of grand satire and disruptive performance art, as you aspire to outdo your guild mates and attract the attention of Rakdos himself.

You work as part of a troupe, with your artistic talents used in service to a ringmaster's vision. But your performance is your own, and no one expects you to follow a script. In fact, if you go through a performance without doing something you haven't done before, you're clearly not trying hard enough.
