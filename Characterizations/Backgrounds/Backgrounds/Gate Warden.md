## Gate Warden

![[Planar Philosopher.webp]]

You spent a significant amount of time somewhere influenced by intense planar forces or a portal to another plane of existence, such as one of the gatetowns in the Outlands. You're accustomed to experiences that would leave others reeling in terror or enraptured by otherworldly beauty, and you're as comfortable dealing with Celestials and Fiends as you are with the vendors in town (who might be one and the same).

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Persuasion, Survival
- **Languages:** Two of your choice (Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal recommended)
- **Equipment:** A ring of keys to unknown locks, a blank *book*, an *ink pen* or quill, a bottle of black ink, a set of *traveler's clothes*, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Planar Infusion

Living in a gate-town or a similar location steeped you in planar energy. You gain the Scion of the Outer Planes feat. In addition, you know where to find free, modest lodging and food in the community you grew up in.

#### Suggested Characteristics

The influence of an Outer Plane shapes your perspective. The Gate Warden Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character.

|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Strange events and otherworldly creatures don't faze me.                                                                                     |
|  2  | I think in terms of exchange: something for something, nothing for nothing.                                                                  |
|  3  | I speak with an unusual cadence.                                                                                                             |
|  4  | I pepper my speech with words or curses borrowed from planar languages.                                                                      |
|  5  | I've seen enough to know that you can't take anyone at face value, so I scrutinize everyone.                                                 |
|  6  | I have a superstitious habit I picked up from my gate-town, such as touching iron when I'm nervous or arranging objects in a specific order. |

#### Building a Gate Warden Character

Those who dwell for an extended time near a permanent portal to another plane absorb the essence radiating from the realm beyond. Those influenced by the same plane share similarities in behavior and even physical appearance.
