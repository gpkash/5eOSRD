# Chosen of Mystra

Chosen of [[Mystra]] appears very rarely, only when the Mother of All Magic herself gifts over a connection to the Weave that only those with her blessing can match. They wield the fabled silver fire in their grasp.

### Maker of Magic
Beginning at 2nd level the gold and time you must spend to craft spell scrolls and enchant magical items is halved.

### Spellsight
Starting at 3rd level, your link to the Weave has improved beyond normal limits, providing you insight and minor influence into and over the Weave itself. You can now identify arcane spells during their casting.

Twice per [[Long Rest]], you can use your Reaction to delay the casting of a spell you can see within 60 feet of you until the end of the round.

### Arcane Resilience
Starting at 6th level, you have grown accustomed to using the Weave to defend yourself from even the deadliest of magics, making you naturally resilient to elemental types of magic.

Choose two types of damage from the following list: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, radiant, and thunder. You have [[5eOSRD/Gameplay/Combat/Resistence/Resistance|resistance]] against spell damage from these two types.

Furthermore, you have advantage on saving throws against spells that deal damage of either of the selected types.

Whenever you take a [[Short Rest]], you can switch one or both of these resistances to another from the list.

### Silver Eyes
Starting at 10th level the silver fire coursing through you bolsters your innate abilities and resistances against harmful effects. Regardless of their previous hue, the color of your eyes is also now bright silver.

You gain [[5eOSRD/Gamemastering/Senses/Darkvision|darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet, you gain [[5eOSRD/Gameplay/Combat/Resistence/Resistance|resistance]] to poison damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease.

Once per [[Long Rest]], you can use your action to gain truesight out to a range of 30 feet and immunity to poison damage, poison, and disease for 10 minutes. When this effect ends, you lose all abilities gained from this feature until after you complete a [[Long Rest]].

### Spellfire Cloak
Starting at 14th level you can cause magical heatless, silver fire to erupt harmlessly from you and surround you until you are [[incapacitated]] or until you use an action to quench it. You gain one of the following benefits of your choice, which lasts until the silver fire ends:

- You can breathe underwater.
- You can survive without food or water.
- ﻿﻿You are immune to magic that would ascertain your thoughts, truthfulness, alignment, or creature type.
- ﻿﻿You gain resistance to cold damage, and you are unharmed by temperatures as low as 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

Furthermore, you now have a number of charges of silver fire equal to your level. You regain expended charges equal to half your level + your constitution modifier daily at dawn.

While the silver fire is present, you have the following additional action options:
- ﻿﻿Cast the [[continual flame]] spell without components at 3rd level This action uses 2 charges of silver hire. If this reduces your number of silver fire charges to 0, the silver fire disappears.
- ﻿﻿Expel eight sparks of silver fire from the silver fire surrounding you in all directions. These sparks fly out and hover equidistantly from one another to form an immobile 10-foot radius protective sphere around you. You can choose up to seven other creatures you can see to gain the positive effects of remaining within the radius of the sparks. You and these creatures have half-cover as long as four or more sparks remain, as the sparks move to intercept any attacks that would target or harm any designated creatures within the radius of the sphere. Creatures that you have not designated must make a [[Dexterity]] saving throw when it enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 fire damage x number of sparks. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much. When there are less than four sparks remaining, this ability ends. This action uses 8 charges of silver fire. If this reduces your number of silver fire charges to 0, the silver fire disappears.
- Release a 60-foot line of silver fire that is 5 feet wide or a 30-foot cone of silver fire. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take 1d12 fire damage x charges of silver fire spent, to a cap of 5 charges. Each creature in the area must succeed on a [[Dexterity]] saving throw, taking 1d12 fire damage x charges of silver fire on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this reduces your number of silver fire charges to 0, the silver fire disappears.
