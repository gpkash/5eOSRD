# Druid

Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an [[elf]] summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Mundane 1/Torch/Torch]]-carrying ores who threaten her forest.

Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a [[human]] peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists' activities.

Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a [[half-elf]] charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.

Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury.

They claim no mastery over nature. Instead. they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.

### Power of Nature

Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces.

The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.

[[Druid spells]] are oriented toward nature and animals the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.

### Preserve the Balance

For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world-air, earth, fire, and water-must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.

Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids' territory.

Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature's balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.

### Creating a Druid

When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.

Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an [[adventuring]] life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.

### Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 [[Wisdom]] ([[Perception]]) check but can't decipher it without magic.

### Spellcasting

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your [[druid spells]] of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these [[druid spells]], you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a [[Long Rest]].

You prepare the list of [[druid spells]] that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of [[druid spells]] equal to your [[Wisdom]] modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a [[Wisdom]] of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *[[cure wounds]]*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a [[Long Rest]]. Preparing a new list of [[druid spells]] requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

>**Sacred Plants and Wood**
>
>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.
>
>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for [[Thrown]] weapons, such as darts or javelins.
>
>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.
>
>**Druids and the Gods**
>
>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature [[Deities]] worshiped in the multiverse. The worship of these [[Deities]] is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.

### Spellcasting Ability

[[Wisdom]] is your [[spellcasting ability]] for your [[druid spells]], since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your [[Wisdom]] whenever a spell refers to your [[spellcasting ability]]. In addition, you use your [[Wisdom]] modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your [[proficiency bonus]] + your [[Wisdom]] modifier

**[[Spell attack modifier]]** = your [[proficiency bonus]] + your [[Wisdom]] modifier

### Ritual Casting

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Adventuring Gear/Druidic Focus]] as a spellcasting focus for your [[druid spells]].

### [[Wild Shape]]

### [[Druid Circle]]

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### [[Timeless Body]]

### [[Beast Spells]]

### [[Archdruid]]

## Druid Circles
- [[Circle of the Land]] ([[PHB]])
- [[Circle of the Moon]] ([[PHB]])

> #### Druids and the Gods
> 
> Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature [[deities]] worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such [[deities]]). The worship of these [[deities]] is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of [[Beory]], the [[Oerth]] Mother, as well as devotees of [[Obad-Hai]], [[Ehlonna]], and [[Ulaa]].
> 
> In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere [[Silvanus]], [[Mielikki]], [[Eldath]], [[Chauntea]], or even the harsh Gods of Fury:
>
> [[Talos]], [[Malar]], [[Auril]], and [[Umberlee]]. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.
>
> The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself-has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits.
>
> Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.
