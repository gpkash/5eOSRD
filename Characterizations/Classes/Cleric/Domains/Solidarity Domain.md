### Solidarity Domain

This subclass was published on July 5th, 2017.
“The worthy must know and respect all others whom the God-Pharaoh deems worthy, for in the afterlife, all will be united in purpose and action.”
Oketra is charged with expounding upon this teaching of the God-Pharaoh, instilling in every initiate the virtue of solidarity. She forges each group of children into a crop of acolytes with just one purpose: to be judged worthy of a glorious afterlife. And she instills in each crop the ability to unite in a single action in pursuit of that purpose. She is fond of poetic imagery to communicate her ideals.
