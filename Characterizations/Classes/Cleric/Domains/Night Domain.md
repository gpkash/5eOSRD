### Night Domain

The night is mysterious, and conceals many unseen dangers. However, the cover of darkness also brings protection from predators and shadows within which one can conceal themselves. The gods of night are varied, encompassing those who would use the cover of darkness to protect others from threats, to those who would use the shadows for wrong doings. The motives of night gods are often shrouded in mystery. Many teach their followers that it is only by peering through the darkness and looking beyond what is hidden that one can attain truth. Clerics of night do their best to keep themselves and their companions safe while journeying through the darkness.

[–]
Beginning at 1st level, a divine blessing grants you the ability to see more clearly in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in magical or nonmagical darkness as if it were only dim light. You can't discern color in the darkness, only shades of gray.
When you reach 6th level, you can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in magical or nonmagical darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in the darkness, only shades of gray.
At 8th level, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical within 120 feet.
Finally, at 17th level, your eyes are able to see the truth hiding within darkness. You gain the ability to call upon the powers of your deity to grant yourself truesight within 120 feet of you for a number of minutes equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of 1 minute). Your truesight only functions while in conditions of magical or nonmagical darkness. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you have completed a long rest.
Ward of Shadows
HWCS p40
[–]
At 1st level, you can create a ward of divine shadows to conceal yourself from an attacking enemy. When attacked by a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, as shadows envelop your form. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
