#### Sanguine Recall

At 6th level, you can sacrifice a portion of your own vitality to recover expended spell slots as an action. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to or less than half your cleric level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You take 1d8 necrotic damage for each spell slot level recovered, which can't be reduced in any way. You can't use this feature again until you finish a [[long rest]].

For example, if you're an 8th-level cleric, you can recover up to four levels of spell slotsâ€”a single 4th-level slot, two 2nd-level slots, a 3rd-level slot and a 1st-level slot, or four 1st-level slots. You then take 4d8 necrotic damage.
