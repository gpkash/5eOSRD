#### Channel Divinity: Blood Puppet
Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to briefly control a creature's actionsâ€”whether that creature is living or dead. As an action, you target a Large or smaller creature or corpse within 60 feet of you that has blood. A creature you target must succeed on a [[Wisdom]] saving throw against your [[spell save DC]] or become [[charmed]] by you. An [[unconscious]] creature automatically fails its saving throw, and isn't [[incapacitated]] while you control its actions. A corpse targeted by this effect gains a semblance of life that you control.

On the affected creature or animated corpse's turn, you can command it (no action required) to move up to half its speed and use its action to do one of the following:
- Interact with an object
- Make a single attack
- Do nothing

An animated corpse or an [[unconscious]] creature takes its turn immediately after yours, but can't move or take actions unless you command it to do so. Its statistics are the same as when it was alive or conscious.
An affected living creature makes a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. For any target, your control lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell).

At 17th level, you can use this feature to target a Huge or smaller creature or corpse.
