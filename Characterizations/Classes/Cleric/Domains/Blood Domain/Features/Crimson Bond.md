#### Channel Divinity: Crimson Bond

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to form a supernatural bond with a creature you can see, or with a creature for which you possess a blood sample. This bond lasts for 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell).
While the bond is in effect, you can use an action to learn the target's approximate distance and direction from you, as well as its current hit points and any [[conditions]] affecting it, as long as the target is within 10 miles of you. Alternatively, you can use your action to attempt to connect with the target's senses. You take 2d6 necrotic damage and the target makes a [[Constitution]] saving throw against your [[spell save DC]]. On a successful save, the bond ends. On a failure, you can choose to either see or hear through the target's senses for a number of minutes equal to your [[Wisdom]] modifier (minimum 1 minute). During this time, you are [[blinded]] or [[deafened]] (respectively) with regard to your own senses. When the connection ends, the bond is lost.

Regardless of the outcome, the target feels a wave of unease pass over it when it makes this save.
