### Arcana Domain

Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.

The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the Realms, deities of this domain include [[Azuth]] and [[Mystra]], as well as [[Corellon Larethian]] of the elven pantheon. In other worlds, this domain includes Hecate, Math Mathonwy, and Isis; the triple moon gods of [[Solinari]], [[Lunitari]], and [[Nuitari]] of [[Krynn]]; and [[Boccob]], [[Vecna]], and [[Wee Jas]] of Greyhawk.

At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.
