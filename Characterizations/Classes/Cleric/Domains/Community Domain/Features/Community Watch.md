#### Channel Divinity: Community Watch

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to instill a feeling of vigilant protection in you and your allies. You grant yourself and a number of allies, up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), a boon from your deity. Allies must be able to see you and be within 30 feet to receive the boon. Once per round, a creature benefitting from this boon can roll aÂ d6, adding the result to a skill check, saving throw, or attack roll. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 round). A creature can only benefit from this effect if it can see at least one of its allies.
