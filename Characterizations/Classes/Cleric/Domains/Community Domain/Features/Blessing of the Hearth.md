#### Blessing of the Hearth

From 1st level, you gain the ability to conjure a small flagstone hearth with a simple iron cooking pot whenever you rest. This hearth helps warm you and your companions, and can be used to prepare hearty and nutritious meals on the road. If you or any friendly creatures you make camp with would regain hit points at the end of a [[short rest]] by spending one or more hit dice, each of those creatures may choose to re-roll one of their resting dice, taking the higher roll between the two.

Additionally, you gain proficiency with [[Cook's Utensils]].
