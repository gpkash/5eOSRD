### Community Domain

The community domain focuses on the ties that bind all people together. These are the ties of family and friendship, the ties to ancestors, as well as the ties between elders and the next generation with whom they share their wisdom. The power of the Gods of community is in the security of home and hearth, and the joy of good company. Many such gods teach the value of tradition and simple ways of living in harmony with the natural world. They also tend towards the rule of law, not as a kind of great bureaucracy, but as sacred traditions passed from generation to generation. Some gods advocate the removal of harsh or disruptive forces to this order, and proper sanctions for the violation of the goodwill that any community ought to provide.

Clerics of such gods value unity, and praise the strength that can be gained when people support each other.
