#### Chains of Carceri

*Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature*

You can cast *[[hold monster]]* at will-targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental-without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a [[Long Rest]] before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.
