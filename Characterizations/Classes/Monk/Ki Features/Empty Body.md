### Empty Body

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become [[invisible]] for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the *[[astral projection]]* spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you.
