### Monastic Tradition

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the [[Way of the Open Hand]], the [[Way of Shadow]], or the [[Way of the Four Elements]], all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.
