### Unarmored Defense

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no [[armor]] and not wielding a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Armor/Shield|shield]], your AC equals 10 + your [[Dexterity]] modifier + your [[Wisdom]] modifier.

### Martial Arts

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk [[Weapons]], which are shortswords and any simple melee [[Weapons]] that don't have the [[Two-Handed]] or [[Heavy]] property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk [[Weapons]] and you aren't wearing [[armor]] or wielding a [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Mundane Items/Shield/Shield|shield]]:

- You can use [[Dexterity]] instead of [[Strength]] for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk [[Weapons]].
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a [[quarterstaff]], you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk [[Weapons]]. For example, you might use a [[club]] that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a [[sickle]] with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.

### Ki

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: [[Flurry of Blows]], [[Patient Defense]], and [[Step of the Wind]]. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or [[Long Rest]], at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to [[resist]] the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Ki save DC** = 8 + your [[proficiency bonus]] + your [[Wisdom]] modifier

## Monastic Traditions

Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.
