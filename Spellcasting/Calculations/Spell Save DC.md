# Spell Save DC

A spell save DC is based on your characterâ€™s current level and main [[Spellcasting Ability]] score. It determines how difficult it is for targets to avoid your spells.

Calculate your spell save DC using the basic formula: 

***8 + [[spellcasting ability modifier]] + [[proficiency bonus]]***
