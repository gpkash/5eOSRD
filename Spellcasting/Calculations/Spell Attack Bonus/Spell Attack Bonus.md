# Spell Attack Bonus

The Spell Attack Bonus (sometimes called spell attack modifier) is one of the stats on the spells page of your character sheet along with Spellcasting Ability and Spell Save DC. Together they represent your character’s affinity for spellcasting.

Sometimes you’ll need to roll to see if your spell hits your mark. Your Spell Attack bonus is what you add to your d20 attack roll. Spells go against the Armor Class (AC) of your target. If your roll plus your spell attack bonus meets or exceeds your target’s armor class, your spell succeeds.

Spell Attack Bonus is only ever added to the attack roll, not to damage. It is calculated using the following formula:

***Spellcasting Ability modifier + your Proficiency bonus***
