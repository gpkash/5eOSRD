# Tools & Kits

A tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your [[proficiency bonus]] to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a [[Dexterity]] check to carve a fine detail with your [[Woodcarver's Tools]], or a [[Strength]] check to make something out of particularly hard wood.
