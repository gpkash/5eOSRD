#### Propeller Helm

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a small humanoid)

---

While worn, the helm allows its wearer to use an action to cast the *levitate* spell, requiring no components. The helm's propeller spins and whirs loudly until the spell ends. Each time the spell ends, there is a 50 percent chance that the helm loses its magic and becomes nonmagical.
