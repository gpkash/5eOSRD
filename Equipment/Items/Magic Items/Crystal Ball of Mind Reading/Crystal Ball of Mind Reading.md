#### Crystal Ball of Mind Reading

Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement), major tier, 3 lb.

---

This *crystal ball* is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the *scrying* spell (save DC 17) with it.

You can use an action to cast the *detect thoughts* spell (save DC 17) while you are *scrying* with the *crystal ball*, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this *detect thoughts* to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends.
