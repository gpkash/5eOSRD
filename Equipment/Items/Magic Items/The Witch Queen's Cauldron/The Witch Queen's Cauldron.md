>
>As explained in the description of Iggwilv's Cauldron, the poem titled "The Witch Queen's Cauldron" is an incantation that hints at the time-freezing property of the artifact:
>
>*Eight cats perch atop eight dead attending*

>*Eight lizards flee from eight rats scavenging*

>*Eight toads climbing meet eight dead and falling*

>*Eight snakes sneak under eight bats screaming*

>*Eight eyes open, always dreaming*

>*All on the cauldron that is ever seeming*
