These bat-like wings were first used by the *Air Ashari* to soar through the sky. They are constructed of either leather and bone, or cloth and wood, and are set onto a sturdy wooden pole that helps their user remain stable during flight.

While these wings are open and you are riding the skysail, you can glide through the air. You have a flying speed of 60 feet, but you must descend at least 10 feet by the end of each of your turns and you can't gain altitude.

Additionally, while in contact with the skysail, you can use an action to cast the *fly* spell on yourself, with a duration of 1 minute and requiring no concentration.

The spell ends if you lose physical contact with the skysail. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn, or unless the skysail is immersed in powerful magic of elemental air. (This includes magic such as that found at the top of the *Summit Peaks* near the rift of air in *Zephrah*, or on the Elemental Plane of Air).

When the skysail is not in use, its wings can be retracted, and its pole can be used as a *quarterstaff*.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
