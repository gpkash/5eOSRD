Carrying the power of Bane, this adamantine morningstar sports foot-long spikes and has a jagged blade on its pommel.

***Sentience.*** The Bloody End is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.

***Personality.*** A tyrannical **pit fiend** named Izeelzee lives within The Bloody End. The weapon boisterously pushes its wielder to subjugate others and to never back down from a challenge. If the wielder doesn't demand fealty from others, the weapon is happy to demand it on their behalf.

***Dormant.*** The morningstar grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Infernal.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- While holding the morningstar, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 13): *charm person*, *dominate person*, or *fear*. Once a spell has been cast using the morningstar, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.
- While holding the morningstar, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
