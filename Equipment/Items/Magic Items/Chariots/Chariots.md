#### Chariots
>
>Chariots and the creatures pulling them work like controlled mounts, as described in the mounted combat rules in the *Player's Handbook*, but with the following differences:
>
>- Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than a number of feet equal to half your speed.
>- Being mounted on a chariot grants you half cover.
>- A chariot's speed is equal to the speed of the slowest creature pulling it.
>- If multiple creatures are pulling the chariot, they all act on the same initiative, and they must take the same action on their turn.
