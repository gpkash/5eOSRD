#### Witherbloom Primer

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

---

The Witherbloom Primer is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven's Witherbloom College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you make an Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself a 1d4 bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the d20.

In addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the druid or wizard spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
