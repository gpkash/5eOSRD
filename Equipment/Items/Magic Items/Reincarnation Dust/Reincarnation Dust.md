#### Reincarnation Dust

Wondrous item, very rare

---

When this small pouch of purple dust is sprinkled on a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid, the dust is absorbed by the remains. If willing, the dead creature returns to life with a new body as if the *reincarnate* spell had been cast on the remains.
