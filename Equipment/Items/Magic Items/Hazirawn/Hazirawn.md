#### Hazirawn

Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement), martial weapon, melee weapon, 6 lb.

2d6 slashing  - heavy, two-handed

---

A sentient (neutral evil) greatsword, Hazirawn is capable of speech in Common and Netherese. Even if you aren't attuned to the sword, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. If you are not attuned to Hazirawn, you deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage when you hit with the weapon.

***Increased Potency.*** While you are attuned to this weapon, its bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and a hit deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage (instead of 1d6).

***Spells.*** Hazirawn has 4 charges to cast spells. As long as the sword is attuned to you and you are holding it in your hand, you can cast *detect magic* (1 charge), *detect evil and good* (1 charge), or *detect thoughts* (2 charges). Each night at midnight, Hazirawn regains 1d4 expended charges.

***Wounding.*** While you are attuned to the weapon, any creature that you hit with Hazirawn can't regain hit points for 1 minute. The target can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect early on a success.

***Heavy.*** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
