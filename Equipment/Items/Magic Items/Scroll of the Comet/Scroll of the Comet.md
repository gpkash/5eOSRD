#### Scroll of the Comet

Scroll, legendary

---

By using an action to read the scroll, you cause a comet to fall from the sky and crash to the ground at a point you can see up to 1 mile away from you. You must be outdoors when you use the scroll, or nothing happens and the scroll is wasted.

The comet creates a 50-foot-deep, 500-foot-radius crater on impact. Any creature in that radius must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 30d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. All structures in the crater are destroyed, as are all nonmagical objects that aren't being worn or held.
