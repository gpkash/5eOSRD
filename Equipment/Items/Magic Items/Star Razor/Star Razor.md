The thick, grooved blade of this shining silver *longsword* is lined with etched runes that sparkle blue in the light. Star Razor—known also as Dwueth'var—was thought to have been destroyed or lost after the *Calamity*, but new rumors suggest that it might be wielded by a half-orc somewhere in *Wildemount*.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Vestige of Divergence.*** *This item is a Vestige of Divergence, see *Tal'Dorei Treasures* for more information.*

Multiple variations of this item exist, as listed below:

- *Star Razor (Dormant)*
