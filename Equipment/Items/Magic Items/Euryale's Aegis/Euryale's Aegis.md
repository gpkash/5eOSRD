This gleaming brass shield bears a relief of the legendary medusa druid **Euryale**.

While wielding this shield, you gain the following benefits:

- **Blessing of Euryale.** You have resistance to poison damage and are immune to the petrified condition.
- **Petrifying Heraldry.** As a bonus action, you can make the front of the shield flare with a medusa's petrifying magic, causing the relief's eyes to glow brightly. Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, or it has the restrained condition as its body turns to stone. The restrained creature must make another DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the start of its next turn. On a failed save, the creature has the petrified condition for 24 hours. On a successful save, the restrained condition ends. Once this bonus action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
- **Spellcasting.** While wielding the shield, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: *Lesser Restoration*, *Locate Creature*, *Transport via Plants*. Once you use the shield to cast a spell, the shield can't cast that spell again until the next dawn.
