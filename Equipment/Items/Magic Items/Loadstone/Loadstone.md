#### Loadstone

Wondrous item, rare, 1 lb.

---

This stone is a large gem worth 150 gp.

***Curse.*** The stone is cursed, but its magical nature is hidden; *detect magic* doesn't detect it. An *identify* spell reveals the stone's true nature. If you use the Dash or Disengage action while the stone is on your person, its curse activates. Until the curse is broken with *remove curse* or similar magic, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, and your maximum load and maximum lift capacities are halved. You also become unwilling to part with the stone.
