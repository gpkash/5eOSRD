1d8 bludgeoning  - Vestige

---

Utilized in countless tortures and slow executions, the hooked chains of this brutal weapon constantly show dried blood and rot. Legend says that Agony was wielded in the *Calamity* by the gnoll scion of a flesh-eating Demon Lord.

***Dormant.*** While Agony is in a dormant state, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Whenever you damage a creature with Agony, that creature is marked for 10 minutes or until you damage a different creature. When you hit a creature marked in this way with this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage.

***Awakened.*** When Agony reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- The extra damage when you hit a marked creature increases to 1d8.
- A marked creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws.
- When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack using Agony, you can immediately make an additional melee attack with this weapon as a bonus action.

***Vestige of Divergence.*** *This item is a Vestige of Divergence, see *Tal'Dorei Treasures* for more information.*
