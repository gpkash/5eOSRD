#### Card Sharp's Deck

Wondrous item, uncommon

---

The cards of this deck shimmer around the edges. While holding this deck, you can use the following properties:

- **Deadly Deal.** As an action, you can use this deck to make a ranged spell attack by throwing a spectral card and using Dexterity for the attack roll. The card has a range of 120 feet and deals 1d8 force damage on a hit.
- **Spray of Cards.** As an action, you can shuffle the deck and cast the *Spray of Cards* spell at 3rd level from the deck (spell save DC 15). Once the deck has cast the spell, it can't cast the spell again until the next dawn.
