#### Lock of Trickery

Wondrous item, common, minor tier

---

This lock appears to be an ordinary lock (of the type described in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) and comes with a single key. The tumblers in this lock magically adjust to thwart burglars. Dexterity checks made to pick the lock have disadvantage.
