1d6 bludgeoning  - versatile (1d8)

---

This crooked staff is carved from bone and topped with the skull of a forgotten **archmage** whom **Acererak** destroyed long ago. Etched into the skull's forehead is **Acererak's** rune, which is known on many worlds as a sign of death.

***Beneficial Properties.*** While the staff is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

- Your proficiency bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) and Intelligence (History) checks is doubled.
- You can't be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, petrified, or stunned.
- Undead with a challenge rating of 2 or lower will neither threaten nor attack you unless you harm them.
- You can wield the staff as a +3 quarterstaff that deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a hit.

***Invoke Curse.*** The Staff of the Forgotten One has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A *greater restoration*, *remove curse*, or similar spell ends the curse on the target.

***The Forgotten One.*** The bodiless life force of a dead **archmage** empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff's skull protects **Acererak** from this spirit's vengeance. Each time a creature other than **Acererak** expends any of the staff's charges, there is a 50 percent chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM's control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a *dispel evil and good* spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead **archmage** attempts to destroy the staff.

***Destroying the Staff.*** A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (24d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone's guess.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
