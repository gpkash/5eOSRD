You may spend your action to blow this horn. If you do, a magical roar is emitted from the horn which can be heard from a distance of 300 feet. Each creature (except the blower of the horn) that can hear the horn is subjected to a certain effect. The effect of the horn changes depending on how many times the horn has been blown that day. Once this horn has been used 3 times in one day, it cannot be blown again for 7 days.

First Blow Each creature that fails a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Second Roar Each creature that fails a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw is deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Third Roar Each creature makes a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d10 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
