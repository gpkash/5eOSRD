#### Storm Caller
_Weapon (any melee weapon), very rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Lightning Sack x1 (Blacksmith)

When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

In addition, if you are outside and holding this weapon, you may spend an action to call a lightning bolt from the sky to strike your weapon, forcing every creature other than yourself within 10 feet of you to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they suffer 6d6 lightning damage, or half that on a success. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
