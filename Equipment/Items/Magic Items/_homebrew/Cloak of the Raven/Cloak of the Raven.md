#### Cloak of the Raven
*Wondrous item, very rare, requires attunement*

![[Cloak of the Raven.png]]

This elaborate cloak is composed entirely of Raven feathers and provides the following benefits to the wearer once attuned.

- When you fall while wearing this cloak, you descend at a rate of up to 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling.
- Any long or high jump can be extended by up to ten feet.
- You can use a bonus action to magically assume the form of a raven. In this form you retain your intelligence and wisdom scores, but otherwise are limited to the abilities in the [[Raven]] creature block. You can remain a raven for a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus and you can transform a number of times equal to half proficiency bonus (rounded up). You regain all uses at dawn.
- If you are knocked unconscious you revert to your original form.
