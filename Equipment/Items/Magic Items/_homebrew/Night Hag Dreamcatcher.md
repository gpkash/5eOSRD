#### Night Hag Dreamcatcher
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Night Hag Hair x1 small pouch (Thaumaturge) 

A creature that sleeps with their head under this item only has good dreams and are immune to any magical effect that would affect its sleep in a negative way. If two creatures sleep under this item, there is a 50 per cent chance that they will enter a shared dream in which they may interact with each other freely.
