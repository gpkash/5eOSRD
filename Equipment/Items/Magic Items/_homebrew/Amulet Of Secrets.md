#### Amulet Of Secrets
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

**Crafted by:** Sphinx Heart x1 (Artificer)

This blood red amulet is set inside a gold frame the colour of desert sand. While wearing and attuned to this amulet, you gain an uncanny ability to disguise your thoughts and emotions. You become immune to any effect that would sense your emotions or read your thoughts, as well as any divination spell that you refuse. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain your intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.

In addition, you may use the amulet to cast the spell zone of truth without using a spell slot or requiring any components. The DC for the casting of this spell in this way is 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus, and you are exempt from the effects of the spell. Once you have used this ability 3 times in one day, you may not use it again until you finish a long rest.
