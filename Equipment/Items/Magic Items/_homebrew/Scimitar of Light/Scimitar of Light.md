Etched upon the blade is written, "amin mela en coiamin" in Elven, meaning "may light shine upon your path".

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At will, you may speak the command word and have the blade glow as though imbued with the [[5eOSRD/Spellcasting/Spells/Light/Light|Light]] spell. A different command word will extinguish the light.

Once per day, you may have the blade emit a blinding flash of light. Enemies that have sight and are within 5' of you roll a CON check (DC 13) and if successful nothing happens. In they fail, they are blinded for 1 round.
