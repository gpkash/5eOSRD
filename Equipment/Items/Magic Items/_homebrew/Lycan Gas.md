#### Lycan Gas
_Poison, rare_

**Crafted by:** Lycanthrope Blood x1 (Alchemist)

This vial of silvery white gas reacts strongly with air and expands to a 30-foot radius cloud as soon as the vial is opened. Any creature that starts their turn in the cloud must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be cursed with lycanthropy. The type of lycanthropy and the DC depends on the type of lycan this gas was created from as outlined in the table below.

The gas cloud remains for 1 minute before dispersing naturally. It may be dispersed early by a strong wind such as that created by the gust of wind spell.

| Lycan Type | DC|
