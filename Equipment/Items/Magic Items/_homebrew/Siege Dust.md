#### Siege Dust
_Wondrous item, very rare_

**Crafted by:** Goristro Horn x2 (Blacksmith)

This bag of fine brown dust contains great magical energy that can be imparted on weapons that are left to soak in its power. If a melee weapon that deals bludgeoning damage is left in a bath of this dust for 24 hours, it gains the following properties permanently:
- Any attack and damage roll made with this weapon is made with a +3 bonus.
- Any attack made with this weapon to an object or structure deals double damage.
- Any attack made with this weapon ignores an object's damage threshold if it has one.
- If the wielder of this weapon moves at least 15 feet straight towards a target and then hits them with a melee weapon attack with this weapon, that target suffers an extra 4d8 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked prone.
