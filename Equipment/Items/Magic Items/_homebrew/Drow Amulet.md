#### Drow Amulet
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Mark of Lolth x1 (Thaumaturge)

While you are wearing this amulet, you gain a darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. You may also use the item to cast the dancing lights cantrip, as well as the faerie fire and darkness spells. The two latter spells may only be used once each per long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all of these spells.
