---

Raven's Reflection is a hand mirror containing a pocket dimension that can be used to capture only one living creature. This dimension takes the form of a fifteen-square-foot stone room with no doors. The only object in the room is a standing mirror through which the creature contained within can view the outside world from the perspective of the hand mirror.
  
- As an action, you can say the command word and instantly transport a creature of large size or smaller either into or out of Raven's Reflection within 30' so long as they can see their reflection. Creature's who are faithful to the Raven Queen are immune to this effect and may choose.
  
- The standing mirror inside has 100 hit points and is immune to all damage types except bludgeoning and piercing. It is [[Vulnerable]] to thunder and force damage.

- Alternatively, the DM may choose to also include a puzzle that the occupant can solve in order to exit. 

- Upon destroying the standing mirror or solving the puzzle, the occupant is instantly ejected from the hand mirror and will land in any unoccupied space 30' from it of the occupant's choosing.

- A broken mirror will be unusable for the remainder of the day and mend itself at dawn.
