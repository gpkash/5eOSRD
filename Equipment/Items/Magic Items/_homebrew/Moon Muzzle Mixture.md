#### Moon Muzzle Mixture
_Potion, rare_

**Crafted by:** Lycanthrope Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)

Drinking this potion completely cures a creature of lycanthropy if taken before that creature experiences its first full moon as a lycanthrope. If drunk after that, or if drunk by a natural born lycanthrope, a lycanthrope is able to ignore the usual transformative effects of the full moon for the next 28 days.
