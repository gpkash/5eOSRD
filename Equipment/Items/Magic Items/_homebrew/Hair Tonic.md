#### Hair Tonic
_Oil, common_

**Crafted by:** Satyr Hair x1 small pouch (Alchemist)

When you massage this tonic into a patch of skin for 1 minute, that patch of skin experiences extremely rapid hair growth, even if hair growth in that area is not usually possible. Each day for the next 7 days, roll 1d6. You grow that many inches in hair over the course of the day in that area.

This bottle has enough hair tonic to cover 10 square feet of skin.
