#### Helm Of The Illithid
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Mind Flayer Brain x1 (Artificer)

While wearing this helmet, you have telepathy out to a range of 120 feet. In addition, you may spend an action to magically emit psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 4d8 psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
