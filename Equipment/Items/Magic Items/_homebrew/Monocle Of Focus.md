#### Monocle Of Focus
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Cyclops Eye x1 (Artificer)

While wearing this item, you may spend an action to focus on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you and designate them as your target. You never suffer from disadvantage when you make weapon attacks against your target, and any opportunity attacks you make against your target is done at advantage.

If you lose sight of your target, or if you make an attack against a creature that is not your target, this effect ends immediately.
