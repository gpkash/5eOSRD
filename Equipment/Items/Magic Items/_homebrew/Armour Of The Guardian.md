#### Armour Of The Guardian
_Armour (breastplate), rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Shield Guardian Breastplate x1 (Blacksmith) While wearing this armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You also gain a special connection to the wearer of the amulet that was connected to the shield guardian that provided the breastplate to craft this armour. Whenever the wearer of that amulet takes damage and is within 60 feet of you, half of that damage (rounded up) is transferred to you.

In addition, whenever a creature makes an attack against the wearer of the amulet, you may use your reaction to grant a +2 bonus to the wearer's AC if you are within 5 feet of them.
