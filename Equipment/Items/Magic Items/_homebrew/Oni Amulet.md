#### Oni Amulet
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Oni Heart x1 (Artificer)

The heart of an oni, transfigured into a dark crystal. It seems to pulse with the corrupted radiance of the night, and those that gaze at it long enough swear they can see two pinpricks of white gazing back at them. While attuned to this amulet, you become more oni-like as your eyes become black with large white pupils, and two small, white, ivory nubs grow out of your forehead. If you are both wearing and attuned to this amulet, you gain the following benefits:
- You may spend a bonus action to summon a magical glaive into your empty hand. You are proficient in wielding this glaive if you weren't already before. In addition, if for whatever reason you grow in size, this glaive grows in proportion with you and deals an additional 1d10 damage if you become larger than Medium sized. This glaive disappears if it is out of your hand for more than 1 minute.
- You gain darkvision out to 60 ft.
- You gain proficiency in the Deception skill if you did not have it already.
- You can speak and understand Giant if you could not already.
- You may cast the charm person spell once per day. Your spell DC for the casting of this spell is 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.
