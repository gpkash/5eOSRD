#### Demon Bomb
_Wondrous item, rare_

**Crafted by:** Balor Ashes 1x small pouch (Alchemist)

This bomb is a black iron sphere filled with balor ashes and explosive elements and is roughly the size of an orange. You may spend an action to light and throw this item at a point within 20 feet. At the end of your next turn, this item will explode, forcing all creatures within 20 feet of it to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 15d6 fire damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

The explosion ignites flammable objects in this area that aren't being worn or carried.
