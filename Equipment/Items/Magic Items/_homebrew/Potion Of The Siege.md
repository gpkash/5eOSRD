#### Potion Of The Siege
_Potion, rare_

**Crafted by:** Goristro Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the enlarge/reduce. In addition, you gain a Strength score of 25 if it was lower than that before, and all of your attacks deal double damage to objects and structures. This potion seems to throb with a dull energy every few seconds, and glass containers holding it seem to crack slightly.
