#### Fomorian Crystal
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Fomorian Eye x1 (Artificer)

While holding this item, you may spend your action to force a creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, that creature takes 6d8 psychic damage and is cursed with magical deformities. While deformed, the creature has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks, saving throws, and attacks based on Strength or Dexterity. On a success, a creature only takes half damage and suffers no deformities. A transformed creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it finished a long rest, ending the effect on a success. Once used, this ability may not be used again until the next dawn. If this item goes 24 hours without its ability being used, it automatically attempts to use it on the nearest creature within range, including the holder.
