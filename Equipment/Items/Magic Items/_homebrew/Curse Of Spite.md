#### Curse Of Spite
_Wondrous item, rare_

**Crafted by:** Wraith Energy x1 (Thaumaturge)

This scroll contains blasphemous words written in a dark ink, that when read aloud can permanently alter the makeup of a magical object. You may spend 1 hour reading this scroll aloud while holding a magical item. At the end of that hour, that item permanently becomes a cursed item with a curse that reads as follows:
> Curse: "A creature afflicted by this curse experiences intense feelings of spite towards every other living creature around them. If the cursed creature interacts with another humanoid creature for the first time, they must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or develop feelings of extreme hatred for that creature. If they fail by 5 or more, they are compelled to kill that creature at any cost. A creature that the cursed creature considers a friend may attempt to calm them down by succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check. A creature that dies while under the effects of this curse has their soul transformed into a wraith instead of moving on to the afterlife. At this point, only a wish spell can change their soul back to its original state and allow it to move on."

This curse ends permanently on both the item and the afflicted creature if the remove curse spell or similar magic is cast on the cursed item.
