#### Bronze Companion
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Spark of Creation x1 (Tinker)

This three-inch tall bronze statue is a perfect replica of any beast. When the command word is spoken, the statue comes to life and mimics the actions and behaviour of the animal it is modelled after. It possesses no other traits of its model animal, except flight which it can mimic up to a speed of 10 ft.

This statue is friendly towards whoever spoke its command word and obeys basic instructions given to it.

The statue can make small noises mimicking its model animal and can carry a maximum weight of 1 pound.

If its command word is spoken again, the statue becomes inert once more.
