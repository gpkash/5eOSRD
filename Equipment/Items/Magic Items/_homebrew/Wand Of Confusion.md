#### Wand Of Confusion
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Umber Hulk Eye x2 (Artificer)

This wand has 4 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the confusion spell (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 4th-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you spend.

The wand regains 1d4 charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
