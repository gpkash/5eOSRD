#### Potion Of Stamina
_Potion, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Pegasus Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)

When you drink this potion, you gain a sense of inner strength and vitality. For the next 24 hours, whenever you roll a saving throw to resist an effect that causes exhaustion, you may make that roll at advantage. This potion is a bright blue with what looks like electricity running through it occasionally.
