#### Spectral Gauntlets
_Wondrous item, rare_

**Crafted by:** Spirit Echo x1 (Thaumaturge)

While wearing these gloves, you are able to see into the Ethereal Plane up to a range of 30 feet. In addition, these gloves are capable of touching objects and creatures in the Border Ethereal as if they were on the same plane of existence as you.

If you use these gloves while grappling a creature in the Ethereal Plane, you may spend your action to make a contested Strength (Athletics) check against them. If you succeed, you may pull that creature into your plane of existence and into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. A creature that is forced out of the Ethereal Plane in this way may not return there for 1 minute.
