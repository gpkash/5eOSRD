#### Aboleth Amulet
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

**Crafted by:** Aboleth Brain x1 (Artificer)

This pale turquoise amulet seems to have a faint flicker of something moving in it, like seeing a creature in murky waters. While wearing this amulet, you gain telepathy out to a range of 120 ft., can understand and speak Deep Speech, and become proficient in Intelligence (History) checks if you weren't proficient already.

You may also spend an action to target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by you. This charm persists until either you or the target dies, or if you are on different planes of existence. You and the charmed target may communicate with each other telepathically over any distance so long as you are wearing and attuned to this item.

You may only have up to 3 targets charmed in this way at a time. If you successfully charm another target while you already have 3 targets charmed, the charm effect ends on the creature that you charmed first. Whenever the charmed target takes damage, they may repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from you. If a creature succeeds on either resisting the charm effect or if the charm effect on them ends, they become immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.
