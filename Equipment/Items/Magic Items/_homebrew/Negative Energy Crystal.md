#### Negative Energy Crystal
_Wondrous item, very rare_

**Crafted by:** Death Tyrant Eye x1 (Artificer)

This roughly basket sized crystal generates a 150-foot radius field of negative energy that disrupts the natural flow of life in the area. While in this field, creatures cannot regain hit points, and any humanoid that dies inside it rises one round later as a zombie. This field passes through all solid objects except a layer of silver that is at least 1/2 inch thick. This crystal cannot be deactivated and only stops functioning if it is destroyed.

The crystal has 30 hit points, 15 AC and is immune to poison and psychic damage.
