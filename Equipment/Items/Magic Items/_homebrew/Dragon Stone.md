#### Dragon Stone
_Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Adult Dragon Heart x1 (very rare), or Ancient Dragon Heart x1 (legendary) (Artificer)

You may focus on this item for 1 minute while holding it in order to transform into a half-dragon version of yourself. In this form, you retain all your statistics with the following additions:
- You gain a blindsight with a radius of 10 feet and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.
- You gain a resistance to the damage type corresponding to the dragon from whom this item was crafted.
- You can speak Draconic along with any other languages you already know.
- You may spend an action to perform the wyrmling breath weapon equivalent of the dragon from whom this item was crafted from (Recharges on a 6).

While in half-dragon form, your personality changes to align with that of your dragon colour. Your half-dragon form lasts for 1 hour or until you either spend 1 minute focusing on the dragon stone again to transform back, you die, or you break your attunement to the dragon stone. Once used, this transformation cannot be used again until the next dawn.

If you are attuned to the legendary version of this item, you may engage in deep meditation with the dragon stone for a continuous 24 hours. Once these 24 hours have finished, you transform into your half-dragon form permanently, and the dragon stone crumbles into dust.
