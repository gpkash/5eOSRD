#### Helm Of Hypnotism
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Ultraloth Eye x2 (Blacksmith)

While wearing this helmet, if you force a creature to roll a saving throw to resist being charmed by you, that creature makes that saving throw at disadvantage so long as it can see you. In addition, if you succeed on a saving throw to resist being charmed by a creature you can see, you may spend your reaction to impose an identical effect on that creature, as if you had used that spell or ability yourself.
