As an action, you may speak this weapon's command word to activate its ability for the next minute. While this dagger's ability is active, any damage it deals to a creature that is charmed by you does not count as damaging it or doing anything harmful to it for the sake of potentially ending the charm effect. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
