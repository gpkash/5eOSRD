#### Chimera Kite
_Wondrous item, rare_

**Crafted by:** Chimera Dragon Wing x2 (Leatherworker)

This wondrous kite is normally kept folded up into a single neat pole. You may spend 1 minute unfolding the kite into its flight mode which possesses two great wings, a handle, and a leather harness for the user to strap themselves into.
While in flight mode, a creature strapped into the harness can speak the command word to cause the kite to emit a magical burst of wind behind itself that propels it, and the creature strapped into it, up to 80 feet in the direction that it is facing. This ability may be used up to 3 times before the kite runs out of magical energy. The kite regains 1 use of this ability every 12 hours that it is not used.

While this kite is airborne and horizontal, it travels forward at a rate of 30 feet per round and descends at a rate of 10 feet per round. The user may change the direction they are flying by pulling on the handle.

If the harness is strapped to something that is heavier than 400 pounds, the harness will instead break when the command word is spoken, and the kite will fly away.
