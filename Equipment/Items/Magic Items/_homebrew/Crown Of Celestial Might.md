#### Crown Of Celestial Might
_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Empyrean Heart x1 (Thaumaturge)

This crown either gleams white if it was crafted from a good-aligned empyrean or is a matte black if it was taken from an evil-aligned empyrean. This crown has 9 charges.

While wearing this crown you may spend an action to expend 1 or more charges to do any of the following:
- You cast any of the following spells: greater restoration (5 charges), fire storm (7 charges), plane shift (7 charges, self only), earthquake (8 charges)
- You strike the ground, triggering an earth tremor. All other creatures on the ground within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone (2 charges).
- You bolster all non-hostile creatures within 120 feet of you until the end of your next turn. Bolstered creatures can't be charmed or frightened, and they gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws until the end of your next turn (1 charge).
- You may make a ranged spell attack at a target within 600 feet. On a successful hit, you deal 7d6 damage of one of the following types (your choice): acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, radiant, or thunder. This ranged attack uses your normal spell attack modifier, or your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus, whichever one is higher (1 charge).

Additionally, if you fail a saving throw while wearing this crown, you may spend your reaction and 3 charges to succeed on that saving throw instead.
