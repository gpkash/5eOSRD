#### Unicorn Glue
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Unicorn Hoof x1 (Alchemist).

This slightly translucent pot of glue is the colour of a full moon on a clear day. When a creature attempts to roll hit die during a short rest to recover hit points, 1 dose of this glue may be applied to that creature to allow them to skip the dice roll and instead regain the maximum number of hit points possible.

Alternatively, you may reattach a severed appendage by applying 1 dose of this glue to the respective wound and holding the severed appendage to it for 10 minutes. After this time, the limb completely reattaches itself leaving no mark except a faint scar. One pot of unicorn glue contains enough glue for 5 doses.
