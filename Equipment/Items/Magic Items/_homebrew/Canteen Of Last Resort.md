#### Canteen Of Last Resort
_Wondrous item, common_

**Crafted by:** Ankheg Gaster x1 (Artificer)

This canteen resembles a gourd in the shape of an "8", with the bottom sphere smaller than the top, and with two plugged openings on the top and bottom. When fertile soil is left in the top sphere, the canteen slowly extracts usable nutrients from it, which it filters into an edible slime in the bottom sphere.

The top sphere is capable of holding up to 3 pounds of fertile soil, which if left for at least 16 hours, produces enough slime to provide the nutritional requirements of an average humanoid for a day. This slime has a repugnant taste and expires if not eaten within 24 hours.
