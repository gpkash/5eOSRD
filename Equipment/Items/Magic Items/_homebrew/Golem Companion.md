#### Golem Companion
_Wondrous item, rare_

**Crafted by:** Manual Ashes x1 small pouch (Artificer)

This 3-inch-tall statue is crafted from whichever material the golem its ashes were harvested from was made of.

When the command word is spoken, the statue comes to life and considers whoever spoke the command word to be its master. It will follow any instruction given to it by its master until it is either destroyed or its master speaks its command word again, turning it back into an inanimate statue. While it is within 100 feet, the statue is capable of relaying information telepathically to its master.
Additionally, as an action, its master can see through the statue's eves and hear what it hears until the start of its next turn. During this time the master is blind and deaf in regard to its own senses.

The statue has 10 AC (regardless of material), 4 hit points, has a move speed of 15 feet, and makes perception checks with a +5 bonus.
