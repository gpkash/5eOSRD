#### Fiend Fuel
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Spine Devil Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)

This vial is filled with a concentrated extract of a spine devil's blood and is highly flammable. As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a target within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against the target, treating the vial as an improvised object. On a hit, the target suffers 2d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns and has disadvantage on any saving throw against an effect that would cause them to suffer fire damage.
A creature can end these effects by using its action to make a DC 11 Dexterity check to remove the oil and flames.
