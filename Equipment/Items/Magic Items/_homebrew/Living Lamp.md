#### Living Lamp
_Wondrous item, rare_

**Crafted by:** Fire Giant Heart x1 (Blacksmith)

While holding this 1-foot-tall lamp, you may speak a command word as an action to cause it to do any of the following:
- Cast bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
- Cast bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet.
- Cast bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In this mode, you may adjust the lamp as an action to reduce the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

While holding the lamp, you may speak the command word again to change it to any of the other lighting options, turn the lamp off, or to make it so that the light emitted is only visible to the creature holding the lamp. The fire inside this lamp never runs out of fuel and can burn indefinitely in any environment in which fire is capable of burning.
