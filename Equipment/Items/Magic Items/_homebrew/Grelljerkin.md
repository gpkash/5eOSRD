#### Grelljerkin
_Armour (leather), uncommon (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Grell Hide x1 (Leatherworker)

While wearing this jerkin you become particularly sensitive to the vibrations and electrical currents around you. So long as you are blinded (including if you just have your eyes closed), you have a blindsight with a range of 60 feet.
