#### Repelling Candle
_Wondrous item, common_

**Crafted by:** Ogre Fat x1 vial (Alchemist)

This pale-yellow candle is made from ogre tallow and emits a powerful odour when burned. Any beast that possesses the keen smell trait or similar that starts their turn within 100 feet of this lit candle, must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be forced to spend their turn moving as far away from this candle as safely possible. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This item otherwise acts as a normal candle and will last for a total of 1 hour while lit.
