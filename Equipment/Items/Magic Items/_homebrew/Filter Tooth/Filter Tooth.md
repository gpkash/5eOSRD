# Filter Tooth
*Wondrous item, very rare (curse)*

This mysterious tooth appears to be made of black onyx.

If a curious creature puts this tooth near it's mouth, It will painfully insert itself into their jaw (1d4 damage) and cannot be taken out without a [[Dispel Magic]] spell.

It causes all food to be tasteless (not affect to smell) but the wielder is resistance to all poisons and immune to ingested poison. (they cannot ever get drunk)
