# Kraken Bolt

*Weapon (ballista bolt), very rare*

Crafted by: Kraken Tooth x1 (Blacksmith)

This several-foot-long bolt is designed to be loaded and fired from a ballista, usually one mounted on board a naval ship. An attack made with this bolt has a +10 to hit, range 120/480 ft., deals 6d10 piercing damage upon a successful hit, and ignores any damage threshold of their target. If the attack is being made against an object or structure, this attack deals 12d10 piercing damage instead. Unlike most ballista bolts, kraken bolts may be used again after being shot, so long as they can be retrieved successfully.
