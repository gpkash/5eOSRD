#### Potion Of Winterbite
_Potion, rare_

**Crafted by:** Ice Devil Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)

When you drink this potion, your physiology changes entirely and your blood becomes icy cold for 1d4 hours.

During this time, you are immune to cold damage, and any time a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage, they suffer 2d6 cold damage. This potion is bright blue with frost constantly encasing the glass.
