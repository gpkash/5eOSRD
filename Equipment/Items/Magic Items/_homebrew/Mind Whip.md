#### Mind Whip
_Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunment)_

**Crafted by:** Mind Flayer Tentacle x4 (Leatherworker)

When you make a grapple check, you may choose to do so with this whip instead of using your free hand. If you do so and if you succeed on the grapple check, you may force the grappled creature to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until the grapple ends. While grappling a creature, this whip may not be used to attack another target. Once this ability has been used 4 times in a day, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
