#### Gut Rot
_Potion, common_

**Crafted by:** Violet Fungus Stalk x1 (Alchemist)

When you drink this potion, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted with the disease gut rot. While afflicted with gut rot, any time you attempt to swallow food, you instead suffer 4 necrotic damage and regurgitate that food. At the end of a long rest, you may attempt the saving throw again, ending the disease on a success.

If a creature dies while afflicted with gut rot, a violet fungus sprouts from the mouldering corpse, growing to full size in 2d6 days.
