#### Chuulâ€™s Caress Poison
_Poison, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Chuul Venom x1 vial (Alchemist)

This poison can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the poison takes 1 minute. For the next minute, any creature successfully hit must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.
