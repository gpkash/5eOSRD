#### Petrifying Dagger
_Weapon (dagger), uncommon (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Cockatrice Beak x1 (Blacksmith)

If this dagger strikes any non-living organic matter that is smaller than half a cubic foot in volume, it is instantly turned to stone for 24 hours.

If a tiny creature is hit by this dagger, they must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw against being magically petrified. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 24 hours.
