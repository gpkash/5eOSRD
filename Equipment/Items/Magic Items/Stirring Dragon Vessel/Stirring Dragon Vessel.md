#### Stirring Dragon Vessel

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

---

This vessel can be a potion bottle, drinking horn, or other container meant to hold a liquid.

As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): ale, olive oil, mead, a *potion of healing*, a *potion of greater healing*, a *potion of climbing*, or a *potion of fire breath*. Once this property is used, it can't be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way loses its magical properties if it isn't imbibed within 24 hours.
