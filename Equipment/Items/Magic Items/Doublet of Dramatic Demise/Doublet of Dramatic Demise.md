#### Doublet of Dramatic Demise

Wondrous item, common

---

This striking satin jacket allows you to make the most of your dying moments. When you drop to 0 hit points while wearing this doublet, you do not fall unconscious. Instead, you are incapacitated and your speed becomes 0, but you can speak and communicate.

You make death saving throws as normal, but if you roll a 1 on the d20, you swoon with a loud gasp and die instantly.
