This beautiful golden blade appears to bend and flex like a reed with your movements. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Additionally, the scimitar has 3 charges and regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. While wielding this *scimitar*, you can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to cast the *misty step* spell.

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

***Light.*** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
