---

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning damage.

***Curse.*** This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an *identify* spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed you have vulnerability to piercing and slashing damage.

The wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

If the wearer has a Strength score lower than 15, their speed is reduced by 10 feet.
