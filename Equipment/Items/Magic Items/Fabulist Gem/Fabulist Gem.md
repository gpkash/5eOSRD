#### Fabulist Gem

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

---

This glittering red gem is commonly found embedded in a ring or brooch.

While wearing the gem, you gain the following benefits.

***Counterfeit Coins.*** You can use your action to magically create a pile of coins, worth no more than 100 gp total, in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of yourself. The pile must appear on a surface that can support it. After 1 hour, the coins vanish, regardless of where they are. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Illusory Fashion.*** As a bonus action, you can magically change the appearance of your clothing and armor. You can change the style, color, and apparent quality of what you're wearing, or you can make it appear as if you were wearing different garments entirely. In either case, the changes wrought by this magic fail to pass physical inspection.
