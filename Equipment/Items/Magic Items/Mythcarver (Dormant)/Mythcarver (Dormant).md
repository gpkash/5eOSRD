This incredible silvered blade once belonged to the legendary White Duke, a founding member of the *Golden Grin*, and many other master bards before him. It resonates with nearby musical tones. In the modern era, it is best known as the personal weapon of famed bard **Scanlan Shorthalt**.

***Dormant.*** While Mythcarver is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This longsword's enchantments and light construction also grant it the Finesse property, which allows you to use either your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls when making an attack with this weapon.

Additionally, when you target an ally with your Bardic Inspiration feature, you gain advantage on attacks with this weapon until the end of your turn.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Vestige of Divergence.*** *This item is a Vestige of Divergence, see *Tal'Dorei Treasures* for more information.*

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
