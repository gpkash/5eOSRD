The thick, grooved blade of this shining silver *longsword* is lined with etched runes that sparkle blue in the light. Star Razor—known also as Dwueth'var—was thought to have been destroyed or lost after the *Calamity*, but new rumors suggest that it might be wielded by a half-orc somewhere in *Wildemount*.

***Dormant.*** While Star Razor is in a dormant state, you can hold this magic longsword and use a bonus action to speak the command word *Galas-var*, causing the sword to emit a pale blue glow that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This glow lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

- While this longsword is glowing, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon, and you have resistance to radiant damage.
- You can cast the *faerie fire* spell from the weapon as an action, requiring no components (save DC 13). Once a spell has been cast using Star Razor, that spell can't be cast from the sword until the next dawn.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Vestige of Divergence.*** *This item is a Vestige of Divergence, see *Tal'Dorei Treasures* for more information.*
