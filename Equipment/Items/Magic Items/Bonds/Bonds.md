|  1  | I have a favorite religious hymn that I constantly hum.                                                                             |
|  2  | I must keep a written record of my beliefs and the sins that I witness. When finished, this book will be my gift to the multiverse. |
|  3  | I have cherished memories of Idyllglen, though I've only seen this bucolic town in dreams.                                          |
|  4  | I would die for those who fight beside me, regardless of their faults.                                                              |
|  5  | I seek to honor the angel Zariel by destroying fiends and other evildoers wherever I find them.                                     |
|  6  | The Sword of Zariel has chosen me. I shall not fail to wield it justly.                                                             |
