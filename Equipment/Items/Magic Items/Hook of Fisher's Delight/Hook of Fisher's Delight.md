|  1-10 | Green with copper bands   | This tasty fish provides a day's worth of nourishment to one creature that eats it. The fish loses this property and rots if it's not eaten within 24 hours of being caught.                                                                                                                            |
| 11-14 | Yellow with black stripes | Once removed from the hook, this awful-tasting fish can be thrown up to 120 feet, targeting a creature the thrower can see. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The fish then disappears.                                                                     |
| 15-18 | Blue with white bands     | When released from the hook, this fish squirms free, sprouts wings, follows you around, and sings a beautiful tune in Aquan. It disappears after 2d4 hours or when reduced to 0 hit points. The fish uses the **quipper** stat block, except that it can breathe air and has a flying speed of 30 feet. |
| 19-20 | Gold with silver stripes  | This tasty fish provides a day's worth of nourishment to one creature that eats it and grants 2d10 temporary hit points to that creature.
