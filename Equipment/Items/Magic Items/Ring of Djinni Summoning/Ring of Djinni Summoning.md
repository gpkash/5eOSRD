---

While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word as an action to summon a particular **djinni** from the Elemental Plane of Air. The **djinni** appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.

While summoned, the **djinni** is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the **djinni** defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.

After the **djinni** departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the **djinni** dies.
