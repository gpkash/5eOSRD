#### Amethyst Lodestone

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

---

This fist-sized chunk of amethyst is infused with an amethyst dragon's ability to bend gravitational forces. While you are carrying the lodestone, you have advantage on Strength saving throws.

The lodestone has 6 charges for the following properties, which you can use while you are holding the stone. The stone regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

***Flight.*** As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to gain the power of flight for 10 minutes. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hover.

***Gravitational Thrust.*** As an action, you can expend 1 charge to focus gravity around a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet in a direction of your choice.

***Reverse Gravity.*** As an action, you can expend 3 charges to cast *reverse gravity* from the stone (save DC 18).
