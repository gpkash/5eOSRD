A beautiful, glittering emerald is set within this silver chain, humming with power and possibility. It is said that this amulet was stolen from the neck of **The Changebringer** herself by the **The Lord of the Hells**, and locked within the vaults of Bazzoxan in *Wildemount*. It was later claimed there by a group of Aurora Watch soldiers during an expedition into that grim fortress's abandoned temples.
