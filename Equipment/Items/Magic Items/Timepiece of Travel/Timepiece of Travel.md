#### Timepiece of Travel

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

---

While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Dexterity saving throws and you always know which way is north. Additionally, you can cast the *longstrider* spell on yourself at will.

***Turn-by-Turn Directions.*** You can name any location within 10 miles of your current location that is known to at least one creature also within 10 miles of that location (including you). Once you name the location, a disembodied voice heard only by you provides directions to the location by the safest, most direct route. The voice knows to avoid natural hazards, so that it does not send you through trackless wilderness or into a lake. But it has no knowledge of or ability to help you avoid monsters, enemies, traps, locked doors, and the like.

The timepiece is of no use for reaching locations that are wholly secret or not known to any creatures within range. Once you use this feature of the timepiece of travel, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

***Get Away From It All.*** As an action, you can cast the *teleport* spell. Once you use this feature of the timepiece of travel, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

***Part of a Whole.*** While this component is not installed in the *Orrery of the Wanderer*, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.
