#### Sensory Stone

Wondrous item, uncommon

---

This small, smooth stone contains the essence of a single experience.

As an action, you or a willing creature you designate can touch the stone and experience the sensation as if it happened to the designated creature. The illusory experience is fleeting and harmless, however real it might feel in the moment.

***Record Sensation.*** You can use your reaction to record a short sensation lasting no longer than 6 seconds experienced by a creature of your choice within 30 feet of yourself, infusing the essence of that experience into the stone. This replaces any sensation already stored within the stone.

***Siphon Sensation.*** As a bonus action, you can draw on the stone's magic to end the charmed or frightened condition on yourself, destroying the stone in the process.
