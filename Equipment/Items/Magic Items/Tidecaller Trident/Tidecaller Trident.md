You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic trident. You also have advantage on attack rolls made with this weapon while underwater.

This trident has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge to cast *Control Water* (save DC 15) from the trident or 3 charges to cast *Tsunami* (save DC 15) from it instead. The trident regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
