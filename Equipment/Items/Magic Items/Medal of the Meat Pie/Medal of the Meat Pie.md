#### Medal of the Meat Pie

Wondrous item, common

---

You gain 2d4 + 2 temporary hit points when you use an action to press this medal to your mouth. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again, and the medal becomes nonmagical.

While magical, this medal is slightly warm to the touch (as if it's fresh from the oven) and smells faintly of baked pie crust.
