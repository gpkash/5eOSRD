#### Heart Weaver's Primer

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard), 3 lb.

---

This pristine book smells faintly of a random scent you find pleasing. When found, the book contains the following spells: *antipathy/sympathy*, *charm person*, *dominate person*, *enthrall*, *hypnotic pattern*, *modify memory*, and *suggestion*. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the enchantment school.
- When you cast an enchantment spell, you can expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the first saving throw one target makes against the spell.
