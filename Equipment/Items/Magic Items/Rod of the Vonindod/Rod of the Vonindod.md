#### Rod of the Vonindod

Rod, rare (requires attunement), 100 lb.

---

The **fire giant** Duke Zalto hired a wizard to craft several of these adamantine rods. Each measures 4 feet long, weighs 100 pounds, and is sized to fit comfortably in a **fire giant's** hand. The rod has two prongs at one end and a molded handle grip on the opposite end.

The rod has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 of its expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can grasp it by the handle and expend 1 charge to cast the *locate object* spell from it. When the rod is used to detect objects made of adamantine, such as fragments of the Vonindod construct, its range increases to 10 miles.
