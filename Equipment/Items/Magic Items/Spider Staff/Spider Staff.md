---

The top of this magic quarterstaff is shaped like a spider. It deals an extra 1d6 poison damage on a hit when used to make a weapon attack.

***Spells.*** The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend the requisite number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the staff: *spider climb* (1 charge) or *web* (2 charges; spell save DC 15).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
