---

While holding this *lyre*, you can cast *mending* as an action. You can also play the *lyre* as a reaction when an object or a structure you can see within 300 feet of you takes damage, causing it to be immune to that damage and any further damage of the same type until the start of your next turn.

In addition, you can play the *lyre* as an action to cast *fabricate*, *move earth*, *passwall*, or *summon construct*, and that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.

If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.
