You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic axe. The axe deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to creatures that aren't constructs or undead. If you reduce such a creature to 0 hit points with an attack using this axe, you gain 10 temporary hit points.

This axe is forged from a dark, rust-colored metal and once belonged to the goliath barbarian Grog Strongjaw of Vox Machina.

***Heavy.*** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
