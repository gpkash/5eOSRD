---

Forged from deep red iron, this massive hammer is set with a brilliant fire opal that shimmers with eternal flame. It is rumored to be currently wielded by *Grand Legate Phaestor, the fire giant ruler of Vulkanon*, somewhere beneath the *Cliffkeep Mountains*.

***Heavy.*** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.

***Vestige of Divergence.*** *This item is a Vestige of Divergence, see *Tal'Dorei Treasures* for more information.*

Multiple variations of this item exist, as listed below:

- *Pyremaul (Dormant)*
- *Pyremaul (Awakened)*
- *Pyremaul (Exalted)*
