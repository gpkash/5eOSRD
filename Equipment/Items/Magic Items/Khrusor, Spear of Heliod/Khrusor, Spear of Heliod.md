Heliod wields Khrusor, a spear blessed with the power of the sun. In his hands, it can be pitched from Nyx to any point on Theros. When Heliod lends his weapon to a mortal, it's typically so they can perform some great work in his name or as a test of their worthiness.

***Spear of the Sun.*** This spear grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage.

***Blessing of the Sun.*** If you are a worshiper of Heliod, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:

- **Piety 3+.** You gain 15 temporary hit points each dawn.
- **Piety 10+.** The spear has 1 randomly determined minor beneficial property.
- **Piety 25+.** The spear has 1 additional randomly determined minor beneficial property.
- **Piety 50+.** The spear has 1 randomly determined major beneficial property.

If you aren't a worshiper of Heliod, the spear has 2 randomly determined major detrimental properties.

See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.

***Luminous.*** The spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight.

***Sun's Retaliation.*** When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Spells.*** The spear has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: *guiding bolt* (1 charge), *daylight* (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), *sunbeam* (6 charges). The spear regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

***Destroying the Spear.*** If taken to Erebos's palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Heliod to Erebos, Khrusor is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Erebos's service.

***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
