#### Topaz Annihilator

Ranged weapon, legendary (requires attunement), firearm

2d6 necrotic  - two-handed

---

This magic ranged weapon resembles a *musket*, but in lieu of any ammunition, it holds a glowing yellow scale from a topaz dragon in its heart.

The weapon has a normal range of 100 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it has the two-handed property. It deals 2d6 necrotic damage on a hit. If this damage reduces a creature or object to 0 hit points, the target is reduced to dust. A creature reduced to dust can be restored to life only by a *true resurrection* or *wish* spell.

While the weapon is on your person, you can use an action to cast the *disintegrate* spell (save DC 18). Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Range.*** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
