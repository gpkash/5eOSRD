Beautiful silver scrollwork and priceless cut rubies adorn this set of brass-and-gold armor. Legend holds that it was worn by Duana, High Priest of the **The Dawnfather**, when she was martyred in the Battle of Ghor Dranas in the final days of the *Calamity*. In more recent times, it was worn by **Pike Trickfoot**, a legendary cleric of the **The Everlight**, while fighting against *the Chroma Conclave* and **The Whispered One**.

***Dormant.*** While the Plate of the Dawnmartyr is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing it. When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to rebuke that creature, dealing it 1d6 fire damage.

- The armor's bonus to AC increases to +2.
- You are immune to the frightened condition.
- You have resistance to fire damage.
