An executioner's blade from the *Age of Arcanum*, this magic *greatsword* is one of many similar weapons once used to execute magic-wielding criminals. Though most commonly found in the lands now known as *Wildemount* and *Issylra*, a few such blades have found their way to Tal'Dorei.

If you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can cast the *dispel magic* spell from the sword against the target as part of the attack. Alternatively, you can use an action to cast *dispel magic* from the sword against a target of your choice. If you need to make a check with your spellcasting ability modifier as part of casting the spell, you make this check with a +3 modifier or your own spellcasting ability modifier, whichever is higher.

Once you cast *dispel magic* using this weapon, you can't do so again until the next dawn.

***Heavy.*** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
