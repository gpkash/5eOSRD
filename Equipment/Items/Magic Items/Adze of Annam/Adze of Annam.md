1d12 slashing  - heavy, two-handed

---

This massive adze is said to have been wielded by All-Father Annam, not as a weapon but as the tool he used to shape the various worlds of the Material Plane eons ago.

***Random Properties.*** The adze has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

- 2 minor beneficial properties
- 1 major beneficial property
- 2 minor detrimental properties

***Magic Weapon.*** When a creature attunes to the adze, the artifact magically adjusts its size so that creature can wield it as a greataxe. The adze is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. On a hit, the adze deals an additional 3d12 force damage. It also deals double damage to objects and structures.

***Divine Mattock.*** As an action, you can call upon the might of the All-Father and use the adze to cast *move earth* or *fabricate*. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Heavy.*** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
