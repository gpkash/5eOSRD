#### Scroll of Tarrasque Summoning

Scroll, legendary

---

Using an action to read the scroll causes the **tarrasque** (see the creature's entry in the Monster Manual) to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 1 mile of you. The tarrasque disappears when it drops to 0 hit points and is hostile toward all creatures other than itself.
