1d4 piercing  - finesse, light, thrown (20/60Â ft.), Vestige

Forged with a mercurial metal accidentally drawn from the Realms Beyond, this dagger shimmers with an unsettling sourceless light. It was once wielded by **Vax'ildan, a legendary champion of the Matron of Ravens**. Two raven feathers are linked to its pommel as a memento of its former bearer.

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

***Light.*** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

***Vestige of Divergence.*** *This item is a Vestige of Divergence, see *Tal'Dorei Treasures* for more information.*
