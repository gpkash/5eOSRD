| 1-2 | The bolt explodes in a blast of fire, dealing 3d8 fire damage to the target and each creature within 5 feet of it.                                                                                                                      |
| 3-4 | The bolt freezes the air around the target into jagged ice. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d10 cold damage and be restrained until the end of your next turn. |
|  5  | The bolt releases a pulse of necrotic energy. The target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.                                                     |
|  6  | The bolt shatters to unleash a burst of shrapnel. Make six additional ranged attacks against the target, each of which has a +7 attack bonus and deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit.                                                    |

Once the bolt hits, the enchantment ends and it becomes a normal piece of ammunition.
