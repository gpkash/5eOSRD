---

These mithral-frame goggles with clear diamond lenses were used by the evoker Danoth Oro to spot invisible enemies and scout areas from afar.

***Dormant.*** While wearing the goggles in their dormant state, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Vestige of Divergence.*** *This item is a Vestige of Divergence, see *Tal'Dorei Treasures* for more information.*
