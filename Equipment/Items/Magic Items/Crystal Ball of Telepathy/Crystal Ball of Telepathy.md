#### Crystal Ball of Telepathy

Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement), major tier, 3 lb.

---

This *crystal ball* is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the *scrying* spell (save DC 17) with it.

While *scrying* with the *crystal ball*, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the *suggestion* spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends. Once used, the suggestion power of the *crystal ball* can't be used again until the next dawn.
