---

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

A character attuned to the sword regains the maximum possible number of hit points from expended Hit Dice. However, the attuned character must eat twice as much food each day (a minimum of 2 pounds) to avoid exhaustion (see "The Environment" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook.)

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

***Light.*** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
