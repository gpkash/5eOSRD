#### Shrieking Greaves

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

---

Each of these black leg guards is decorated with a motif of monstrous skulls screaming in terror.

The greaves have 3 charges. While wearing these greaves, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 charge to increase your walking speed by 30 feet, and you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws. These effects last for 1 minute. The greaves regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

***Curse.*** The greaves are cursed, and becoming attuned to them extends the curse to you. You can't remove the greaves or end your attunement to them until you are targeted by a *Remove Curse* spell or similar magic.

You have disadvantage on saving throws against the frightened condition. Whenever you start your turn frightened, the greaves release an ear-piercing scream. You and each creature within 10 feet of you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
