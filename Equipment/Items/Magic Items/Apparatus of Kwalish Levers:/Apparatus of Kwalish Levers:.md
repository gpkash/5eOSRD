|   1   | Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim.                                                                      | Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus's speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.                              |
|   2   | Forward window shutter opens.                                                                                                       | Forward window shutter closes.                                                                                                                 |
|   3   | Side window shutters open (two per side).                                                                                           | Side window shutters close (two per side).                                                                                                     |
|   4   | Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus.                                                                             | The claws retract.                                                                                                                             |
|   5   | Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*  7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. | Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*  The target is grappled (escape DC 15). |
|   6   | The apparatus walks or swims forward.                                                                                               | The apparatus walks or swims backward.                                                                                                         |
|   7   | The apparatus turns 90 degrees left.                                                                                                | The apparatus turns 90 degrees right.                                                                                                          |
|   8   | Eyelike fixtures emit bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.                                     | The light turns off.                                                                                                                           |
|   9   | The apparatus sinks as much as 20 feet in liquid.                                                                                   | The apparatus rises up to 20 feet in liquid.                                                                                                   |
