#### Delver's Claws

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

---

The back of this weatherworn leather glove is adorned with three large metal hooks shaped like a mole's claws. Stitched into the glove's palm is the mountain rune.

The glove is considered a simple melee weapon with the finesse and light properties, and it deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit. While attuned to the glove, you gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed and blindsight to 15 feet.

***Invoking the Rune.*** As an action, you can invoke the glove's rune to bolster yourself with the sturdiness of the earth. Spend and roll a number of your unspent Hit Dice up to a maximum equal to your proficiency bonus. You then regain a number of hit points equal to the total roll plus your Constitution modifier.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.
