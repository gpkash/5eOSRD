---

This dark metal blade bends in a wicked, hooked curve. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, you can spend 1 Hit Die to deal an extra 3d6 necrotic damage.

***Curse.*** This weapon is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an *identify* spell is cast on the weapon or you attune to it. Attuning to the dagger curses you until you are targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic; disposing of the dagger fails to end the curse. While cursed, whenever you receive magical healing, you must spend 1 Hit Die to regain any hit points. If you spend all your Hit Dice at any point, you die.

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

***Light.*** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
