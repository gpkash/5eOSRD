|  1  | I am too quick to judge others.                                                          |
|  2  | I offer forgiveness too readily.                                                         |
|  3  | I will sacrifice innocent lives for the greater good.                                    |
|  4  | Flaw? What flaw? I am flawless. Utter perfection!                                        |
|  5  | I allow nothing to stand in the way of my crusade to eradicate evil from the multiverse. |
|  6  | I ignore those who do not support my plans, for my calling is higher than all others.    |

***Holy Light.*** The sword sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Fiends find the sword's light disconcerting and painful, even if they can't see it, and have disadvantage on attack rolls made within the weapon's radius of bright light.

As a bonus action, you can intensify the sword's light, causing it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet, or reduce its glow to its normal intensity.

***Random Properties.*** The sword has 2 minor beneficial properties.

***Searing Radiance.*** The sword deals an extra 9 (2d8) radiant damage to any creature it hits, or 16 (3d10) radiant damage if you're wielding the weapon with two hands. An evil creature that takes this radiant damage must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

***Sentience.*** The Sword of Zariel is a sentient, lawful good item with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet.

The sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.

***Truth Seer.*** While holding the sword, you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Insight) checks.

***Destroying the Sword.*** Zariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it. She couldn't bring herself to do so when she was an angel, but as an archdevil she has no compunction about ridding the multiverse of the weapon. The sword is also destroyed if it's used to shatter the Companion (see "*Shattering the Companion*"), unless the blade is wielded by an angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level.

If Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the sword becomes no harder to destroy than a normal longsword.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
