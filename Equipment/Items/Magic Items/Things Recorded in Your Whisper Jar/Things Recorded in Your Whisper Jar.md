***Whispered Encyclopedia.*** At rank 2, your whisper jar becomes an uncommon magic item that can tap into the broader lore of Acquisitions Incorporated. As a bonus action, you ask the jar for information on a specific subject and make a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. On a success, the jar plays back a recording on that subject, made somewhere, sometime by another Acq Inc loremonger. This property of the whisper jar can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Whispered Warnings.*** Also at rank 3, your whisper jar gains additional power and becomes a rare magic item. As an action, you can cause the jar to function as a *wand of enemy detection*, whereupon it whispers the direction to foes within range. This property of the whisper jar can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Whispered Arcana.*** Also at rank 4, your whisper jar gains access to even more magic. By whispering the name of one of the following spells into the jar as an action, you can cast that spell from the jar: *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*, *detect poison and disease*, *find traps*, *identify*, or *locate animals or plants*. This property of the whisper jar can't be used again until the next dawn.
