#### Arrow of Slaying (*)

Ammunition, generic variant, very rare, minor tier

---

** This generic variant has the same name and source as the item *arrow of slaying**.

An *arrow of slaying* is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *arrows of dragon slaying* and *arrows of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an *arrow of slaying* takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an *arrow of slaying* deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

***Base items.*** This item variant can be applied to the following base items:

- *Arrow* (*Arrow of Slaying*)
- *Blowgun Needle* (*Blowgun Needle of Slaying*)
- *Crossbow Bolt* (*Crossbow Bolt of Slaying*)
