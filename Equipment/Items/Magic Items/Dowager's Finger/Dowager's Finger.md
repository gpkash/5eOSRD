#### Dowager's Finger
*Wand, Rare, requires attunement by a wizard or cleric*


"A word to lay the dead to rest, to make them walk at my behest, A word to send them back to sleep In blessed dreams their secrets keep."

This wand seems to be the long finger bone of a creature that had large and spindly hands. The nail is still sharp and yellowing.

This ugly and very discomforting finger bone once belonged to a rich dowager who lost her husbands in a series of tragic accidents. Rumour has it she became so miserable that her fingers became long claws with which to scratch at her eyes and carve his name into the furnishings. When she finally died, someone took the finger from her corpse, hoping to sell it. Sometimes the finger still appears in the possession of a stray undead, or a rogue necromancer.

##### Effect

As an action, you can point the wand at an undead creature within 30 feet., commanding them to return to death. If that creature has a Challenge Rating of 1 or less, that creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw versus your spell save DC or be destroyed.

The wand has 10 charges. It regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability:
- animate dead (3 charges)
- gentle repose (2 charges)
- speak with dead (3 charges)
