#### Cataclysm Bolts

Ammunition, very rare, 1.2 oz.

---

These steel *crossbow bolts* were first created by the Jaggenstrike Clan during the *Scattered War*, and the secret to crafting them remains well guarded by the *Houses of Kraghammer*. Cataclysm bolts are usually kept in sets of ten, though anyone who holds even one can feel it thrumming with magical power. When you hit with an attack using a cataclysm bolt, the attack deals normal damage. Then roll a d6 on the following table to determine its additional effect.
