This snakeskin whip is touched by the power of Zehir and ends in five animated serpent heads.

***Sentience.*** The Lash of Shadows is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Draconic.

***Personality.*** A mad **marilith** named Sizlifeth lives within the Lash of Shadows. The weapon has a short temper and experiences only extreme emotions. It is most happy when dealing harm.

***Dormant.*** The whip grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Draconic.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- You can attempt to poison any creature that is hit by the whip. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of one of the following poisons of your choice; once a poison other than Serpent Venom has been used, that poison can't be used again until the next dawn:
  - **Dead Eyes.** A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is blinded.
  - **Serpent Venom.** A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison takes 3d6 poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
