#### Far Gear

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

---

While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Charisma saving throws, and you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

***Aberrant Ally.*** You can conjure an aberrant creature from the chaos of the multiverse to serve you. This functions as the *conjure celestial* spell (no concentration required), except the creature you summon is an aberration of challenge rating 4 or lower. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

***Unnatural Bane.*** You can cast the *bane* spell (save DC 15), which affects any number of creatures within range for 1 minute. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

***Part of a Whole.*** While this component is not installed in the *Orrery of the Wanderer*, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.
