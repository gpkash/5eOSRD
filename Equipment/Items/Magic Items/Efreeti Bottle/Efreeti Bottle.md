---

This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an **efreeti** appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the DM rolls to determine what happens.

| 01-10 | The **efreeti** attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the **efreeti** disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 11-90 | The **efreeti** serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the **efreeti** returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the **efreeti** escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 91-00 | The **efreeti** can cast the *wish* spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
