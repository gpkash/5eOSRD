Wondrous item, common

This small capsule is made of beeswax blended with sand and a variety of enchanted water plants. A creature who consumes a pressure capsule ignores the effects of swimming at depths greater than 100 feet (see "*Unusual Environments*" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
