#### Horn of Valhalla, Silver

Wondrous item, rare, major tier, 2 lb.

---

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the **berserker** statistics. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

The silver horn summons 2d4 + 2 **berserkers**.

The **berserkers** are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
