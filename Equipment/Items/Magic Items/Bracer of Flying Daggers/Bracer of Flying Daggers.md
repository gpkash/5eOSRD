#### Bracer of Flying Daggers

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

---

This armband appears to have thin *daggers* strapped to it. As an action, you can pull up to two magic daggers from the bracer and immediately hurl them, making a ranged attack with each dagger. A dagger vanishes if you don't hurl it right away, and the daggers disappear right after they hit or miss. The bracer never runs out of daggers.
