| 85-86 | The moonblade functions as a *defender*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 91-92 | When you hit with an attack using the moon blade, the attack deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 93-94 | When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as dragon, fiend, or undead) with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 95-96 | You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon.                      |
| 97-98 | The moonblade functions as a *ring of spell storing*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|   99  | You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don't already have one serving you. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a **shadow**, except it is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, and doesn't create new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action. |
|   00  | The moonblade functions as a *vorpal sword*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

***Sentience.*** A moon blade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.

***Personality.*** Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose.

The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.

If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
