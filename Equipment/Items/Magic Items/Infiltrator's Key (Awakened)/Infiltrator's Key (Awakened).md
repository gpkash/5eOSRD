This mithral skeleton key was forged using the blood of twelve master thieves executed for trying to steal magic items during the Age of Arcanum.

***Dormant.*** The Infiltrator's Key grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- The key can be used as *thieves' tools* for the purpose of opening locks. When using the key, you are considered proficient in *thieves' tools* and you have advantage on ability checks made to open locks.
- While holding the key, your steps are muffled, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to move silently.

***Awakened.*** When the Infiltrator's Key reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

- While holding the key, you can use a bonus action to transform the key into a magic dagger or back into a key. While the key is in the form of a dagger, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it returns to your hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.
- While holding the key, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: *alter self*, *invisibility*, *knock*, or *pass without trace*. Once a spell has been cast using the key, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.

***Vestige of Divergence.*** *This item is a Vestige of Divergence, see *Tal'Dorei Treasures* for more information.*
