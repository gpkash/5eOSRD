#### Dragon Thighbone Club

Weapon (greatclub) (attunement optional), simple weapon, melee weapon, 250 lb.

1d8 bludgeoning  - two-handed

---

This red dragon's thighbone is 14 feet long, 250 lbs, and is wrapped in old leather, suggesting that it was once used as a giant's greatclub.

When you hit a creature of the dragon type with this weapon, it deals an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage.

If you attune to the greatclub, it magically shrinks to a size that you can wield effectively.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
