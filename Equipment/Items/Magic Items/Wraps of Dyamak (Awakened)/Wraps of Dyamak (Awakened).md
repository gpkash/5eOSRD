---

Created and wielded by the ancient warrior-monk Dyamak, these thick strips of enchanted cloth are stained to appear dark crimson with blood of unknown origin. The current resting place of the wraps is unknown.

***Dormant.*** When the Wraps of Dyamak are in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with your unarmed strike while wearing them.

In addition, when you finish a short or long rest, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your total number of ki points.

***Awakened.*** When the Wraps of Dyamak reach an awakened state, they gain the following properties:

- The bonus to attack and damage rolls with your unarmed strike increases to +2.
- You can cast the *misty step* spell from the wraps as a bonus action, vanishing in a cloud of crimson mist. This property of the wraps can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest, or until you score a critical hit with an unarmed strike against a hostile creature.

***Vestige of Divergence.*** *This item is a Vestige of Divergence, see *Tal'Dorei Treasures* for more information.*
