#### Cost of a Spelljamming Helm
>
>A spelljamming helm propels and steers a ship much as sails, oars, and rudders work on a seafaring vessel, and a spelljamming helm is easy to create if one has the proper spell. *Create spelljamming helm* has a material component cost of 5,000 gp, so that's the least one can pay to acquire a spelljamming helm.
>
>Wildspace merchants, including **dohwars** and **mercanes** (both described in *Boo's Astral Menagerie*), typically sell a spelljamming helm for substantially more than it cost to make. How much more depends on the market, but 7,500 gp would be a reasonable demand. A desperate buyer in a seller's market might pay 10,000 gp or more.
