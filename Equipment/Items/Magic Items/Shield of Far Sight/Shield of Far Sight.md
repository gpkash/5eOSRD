#### Shield of Far Sight

Armor (shield), rare, 6 lb.

AC +2

---

A **mind flayer** skilled at crafting magic items creates a shield of far sight by harvesting an eye from an intelligent humanoid and magically implanting it on the outer surface of a nonmagical shield. The shield becomes a magic item once the eyes is implanted, whereupon the **mind flayer** can give the shield to a thrall or hang it on a wall in its lair. As long as the shield is on the same plane of existence as its creator, the **mind flayer** can see through the shield's eye, which has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. While peering through this magical eye, the **mind flayer** can use its Mind Blast action as though it were standing behind the shield.

If a shield of far sight is destroyed, the **mind flayer** that created it is blinded for 2d12 hours.
