#### Boots of Haste

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

---

While you wear these boots, you can click your heels together to cast the *haste* spell on yourself as a bonus action. You don't suffer from lethargy when the spell ends when cast using these boots. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until next dawn.
