A powerful relic passed down from generation to generation of Ashari leaders, the Spire of Conflux was lost over three centuries ago when Joran the Sea-Speaker, a respected leader of *the Water Ashari*, was devoured by a demon of the Abyss. It was rediscovered by the legendary druid **Keyleth of Zephrah, Voice of the Tempest**. However, rumors swirl that she is seeking another hero to wield it—one who can travel the land and do good in small ways as she once did.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Vestige of Divergence.*** *This item is a Vestige of Divergence, see *Tal'Dorei Treasures* for more information.*

Multiple variations of this item exist, as listed below:

- *Spire of Conflux (Dormant)*
- *Spire of Conflux (Awakened)*
- *Spire of Conflux (Exalted)*
