---

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you use this axe to make an attack against a plant (an ordinary plant or a creature with the Plant type) or a wooden object that isn't being worn or carried, the attack deals an extra 2d6 slashing damage on a hit.

***Heavy.*** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
