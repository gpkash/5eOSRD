---

The handle of this dark leather whip bears the fire rune, and embers dance around the whip's tail.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and on a hit, the whip deals an extra 1d6 fire damage. When you score a critical hit with an attack using this whip, the target also has the restrained condition until the start of your next turn, as fiery bands lash around the target.

***Invoking the Rune.*** When you make an attack with the whip and hit, you can use your reaction to invoke the whip's rune. Doing so increases the extra fire damage dealt by the whip to 2d6.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

***Reach.*** This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. This property also determines your reach for opportunity attacks with a reach weapon.
