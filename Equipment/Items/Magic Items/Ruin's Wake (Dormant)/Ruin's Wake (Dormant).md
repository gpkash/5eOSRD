The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Orc.

***Personality.*** A slaughter-loving **balor** named Yarrowish lives within Ruin's Wake. The weapon desires only to draw blood and pushes its wielder to solve problems with violence.

***Dormant.*** The spear grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Orc.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra 1d8 piercing damage to any target it hits. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it flies back to your hand.
- As a reaction when you are hit by a melee attack, you can make a melee attack with Ruin's Wake with advantage against the attacker. You can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.
