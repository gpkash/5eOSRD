1d6 piercing  - finesse, thrown (20/60 ft.), versatile (1d8)

---

A silver spear, Windvane has dark sapphires on the filigreed surface of its polished head. Held by its shining haft, the weapon feels insubstantial, as if clutching a cool, gently flowing breeze. The spear contains a spark of **Yan-C-Bin**, the Prince of Evil Air.

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the finesse weapon property. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

***Air Mastery.*** You gain the following benefits while you hold Windvane:

- You can speak Auran fluently.
- You have resistance to lightning damage.
- You can cast *dominate monster* (save DC 17) on an **air elemental**. Once you have done so, Windvane can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

***Song of the Four Winds.*** While inside an air node, you can perform a ritual called the Song of the Four Winds, using Windvane to create a *devastation orb of air*. Once you perform the ritual, Windvane can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

***Flaw.*** Windvane makes its wielder mercurial and unreliable. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I break my vows and plans. Duty and honor mean nothing to me."

***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
