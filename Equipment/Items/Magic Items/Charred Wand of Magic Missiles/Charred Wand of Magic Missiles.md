#### Charred Wand of Magic Missiles

Wand, uncommon, 1 lb.

---

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the *magic missile* spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

Each time you expend a charge from this wand, there is a 50 percent chance that nothing happens and the charge is wasted.
