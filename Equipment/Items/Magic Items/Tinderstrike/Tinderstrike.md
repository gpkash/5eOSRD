1d4 piercing  - finesse, light, thrown (20/60Â ft.)

---

A flint dagger, Tinderstrike is uncommonly sharp, and sparks cascade off its edge whenever it strikes something solid. Its handle is always warm to the touch, and the blade smolders for 1d4 minutes after it is used to deal damage. It contains a spark of **Imix**, Prince of Evil Fire.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 2d6 fire damage.

***Fire Mastery.*** You gain the following benefits while you hold Tinderstrike:

- You can speak Ignan fluently.
- You have resistance to fire damage.
- You can cast *dominate monster* (save DC 17) on a **fire elemental**. Once you have done so, Tinderstrike can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

***Dance of the All-Consuming Fire.*** While inside a fire node, you can perform a ritual called the Dance of the All-Consuming Fire, using Tinderstrike to create a *devastation orb of fire*. Once you perform the ritual, Tinderstrike can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

***Flaw.*** Tinderstrike makes its wielder impatient and rash. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I act without thinking and take risks without weighing the consequences."

***Finesse.*** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

***Light.*** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

***Thrown.*** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
