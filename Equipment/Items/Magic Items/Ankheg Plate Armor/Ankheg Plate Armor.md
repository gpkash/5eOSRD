# Ankheg Plate Armor

![[Ankheg_Plate.jpg]]

**Ankheg plate armor** was a suit of armor that was crafted from the chitinous shell of an ankheg). Despite its name, it was not _true_ plate armor but rather offered its wearer similar protection in combat and could be worn by druids (except the full-plate variant).

This armor was highly valued for its lightness, as it weighed significantly less than metal plate armor. As such it cost anywhere from 4,000 - 6,000 gp and took between one to three days to be made.

While wearing this armor, you gain resistance to acid for the medium armor variants you may add a max of 3 (instead of 2) for DEX AC bonus.
