This delicate silver tiara is decorated with stellar iconography. While you wear the crown, the gems on the tiara's points detach and closely orbit your head.

The crown has 6 charges for the following properties, which you can use while wearing the crown:

- **Star Flight.** As a bonus action, you can spend 1 charge to gain the power of flight for 10 minutes. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hover. While flying, you glow faintly with starlight.
- **Starlight Strike.** As an action, you can spend any number of charges to launch bolts of frigid starlight. You launch a number of bolts equal to the number of charges spent, and you can direct the bolts to target one creature or several, so long as all creatures are within 120 feet of you and you can see them. The bolts automatically strike their targets, and each bolt deals 2d4 cold damage.
- **Whirling Hail.** As an action, you can spend 3 charges and cast the *Ice Storm* spell (save DC 16).
  The crown regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.
