A powerful relic passed down from generation to generation of Ashari leaders, the Spire of Conflux was lost over three centuries ago when Joran the Sea-Speaker, a respected leader of *the Water Ashari*, was devoured by a demon of the Abyss. It was rediscovered by the legendary druid **Keyleth of Zephrah, Voice of the Tempest**. However, rumors swirl that she is seeking another hero to wield it—one who can travel the land and do good in small ways as she once did.

***Dormant.*** While the Spire of Conflux is in a dormant state, the staff has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *burning hands* (1 charge) or *fireball* (3 charges).

Additionally, while holding this staff, you have a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC increases by 1.

***Awakened.*** When the Spire of Conflux reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- The staff has 12 charges, and it regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn.
- You can also spend charges to cast the following spells from the staff: *conjure elemental* (5 charges) or *ice storm* (4 charges).
- When you cast a spell that deals bludgeoning, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage and you roll a 1 on a damage die, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

***Exalted.*** When the Spire of Conflux reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:

- The staff has 20 charges, and it regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.
- You can also spend charges to cast the following spells from the staff: *chain lightning* (6 charges) or *fire storm* (7 charges)
- The bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC increases to +2.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
