#### Harp of Gilded Plenty

Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)

---

This golden harp is sculpted in the image of the god Iallanis, depicted as a young cloud giant woman. When a creature comes within 5 feet of the harp, the instrument animates and is capable of speaking, singing, and playing by itself.

Whenever you attempt to attune to the harp, you must first make either a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check or a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the harp that you are worthy, attuning to the harp on a success. If you fail, you can't attempt to attune to the harp again until the next dawn. Once you have successfully attuned to the harp, the harp resizes to suit you.

***Stalwart Song.*** Whenever you make a Charisma check while attuned to the harp, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the die as a 10.

***Feast of Plenty.*** If you spend 10 minutes playing the harp, you can cast the *heroes' feast* spell from it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until 1d10 + 10 days have passed.

***Soothing Melody.*** As an action, you can use the harp to cast the *calm emotions* spell (save DC 19). When the spell is cast using the harp, its duration increases to 1 hour, provided you maintain concentration on the spell. This property can be used five times, and it regains all uses at dawn.

***Sentience.*** The harp is a sentient, chaotic good object with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet.

The harp can speak, read, and understand Common and Giant. It can also communicate telepathically with the creature attuned to it.

The harp has a dramatic and pompous personality, taking extreme pride in the quality of music produced from its strings. If the harp is shorter than 6 feet tall, it bemoans its height.
