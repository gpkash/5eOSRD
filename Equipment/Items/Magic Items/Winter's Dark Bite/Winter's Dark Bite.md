You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This greatsword is made of an unknown black metal. In most cases, it works as a *+1 greatsword*. But when used against a **thessalhydra**, it works as a *+3 greatsword*. While in the Upside Down, it works as a +4 greatsword.

***Heavy.*** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

***Two-Handed.*** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
