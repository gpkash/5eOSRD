#### Horn of the Endless Maze

Wondrous item, rare, 2 lb.

---

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Abyss appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits look like minotaurs, and use the **berserker** statistics. They return to Abyss after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

The horn summons 3d4 + 3 **berserkers**. To use the horn, you must be proficient with all simple weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned **berserkers** attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
