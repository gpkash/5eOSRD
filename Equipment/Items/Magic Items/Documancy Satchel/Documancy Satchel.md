At rank 2, your documancy satchel becomes a common magic item, allowing you to magically send and receive documents to and from Head Office through a special pouch. Your documancy satchel magically produces prewritten and signature-ready contracts at your request, covering most common contractual needs. It also occasionally produces sticky notes printed with useful information and inspirational quotes from Head Office.

***Satchel of Holding.*** At rank 3, your documancy satchel gains additional features and becomes an uncommon magic item. One of the satchel's pouches now functions as a *bag of holding*.

Additionally, you can use an action to draw forth from the documancy satchel a *spell scroll* of *comprehend languages*. The scroll vanishes when used, or ten minutes after it appears. This property of the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Scroll Humidor.*** At rank 4, your documancy satchel gains additional power and becomes a rare magic item. Within the satchel, a dedicated extradimensional space can hold up to thirty documents or *spell scrolls*. Placing a single document into the scroll humidor is an action. Drawing forth a desired scroll is a bonus action.
