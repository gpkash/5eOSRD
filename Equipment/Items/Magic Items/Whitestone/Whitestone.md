#### Whitestone

Trade good

---

The sheer amount of leftover arcane power within the whitestone of the *Alabaster Sierra* mountains is incredibly receptive to enchantment. Magic items that incorporate at least an ounce of whitestone into their construction require only one-quarter the creation time of other magic items. Some alchemists in *Emon* have discovered that dissolving whitestone with specific acids can leave behind pure *residuum*, which can substitute for expensive spell components when such materials are not readily available.

Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).

Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency.
