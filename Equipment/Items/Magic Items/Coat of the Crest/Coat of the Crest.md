#### Coat of the Crest

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

---

This exquisite brocade coat is cut in a long, high-collared style popular among nobles of the Clovis Concordâ€”a nation on the west coast of *Wildemount* whose stylish fashion is often mimicked in Tal'Dorei. Its shimmering lining hints at its magical properties. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this coat, which can be worn over light armor.

Additionally, the coat has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you are the target of an attack while wearing this coat, you can spend 1 charge as a reaction to gain resistance to one type of damage from the triggering attack. This resistance is effective against the triggering attack and lasts until the start of your next turn.
