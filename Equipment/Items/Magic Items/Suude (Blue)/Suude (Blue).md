#### Suude (Blue)

Illegal drug

---

Exandria's most infamous drug, *suude* is a glittering powder made from *residuum*. It was first developed by power-hungry archmages in the *Age of Arcanum* as an incense burned to enhance focus during ritual spellcasting. The secret to its refinement has been lost and rediscovered a variety of times since the *Calamity*, and many different types of *suude* have been developed by arcanists in search of ever-greater power. It has terrible addictive and mentally degenerative properties, even when used sparingly.

After burning *suude* within a vessel and inhaling its fumes as an action, you take 22 (4d10) psychic damage and must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you become poisoned for 1 hour and fall unconscious for 1 minute, or until you are shaken awake as an action. During this time, the world seems to move in slow motion, and your vision is twisted in kaleidoscopic colorsâ€”yet your focus is never distorted. If one dose of *suude*, or more, is used within 1 hour of another, the DC of the Constitution saving throw is increased by 5 per additional dose. If you fail this save by 10 or more, you instantly drop to 0 hit points.

On a success, you gain the ability to use one of the following Metamagic options as a sorcerer for the next minute, requiring no sorcery points. The type of Metamagic you gain access to depends on the type of *suude*, and once you use it, you can't use it again until you inhale *suude* again.

Blue suude allows you to use the Twinned Spell Metamagic option.
