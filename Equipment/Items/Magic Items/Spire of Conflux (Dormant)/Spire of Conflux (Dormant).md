A powerful relic passed down from generation to generation of Ashari leaders, the Spire of Conflux was lost over three centuries ago when Joran the Sea-Speaker, a respected leader of *the Water Ashari*, was devoured by a demon of the Abyss. It was rediscovered by the legendary druid **Keyleth of Zephrah, Voice of the Tempest**. However, rumors swirl that she is seeking another hero to wield it—one who can travel the land and do good in small ways as she once did.

***Dormant.*** While the Spire of Conflux is in a dormant state, the staff has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *burning hands* (1 charge) or *fireball* (3 charges).

Additionally, while holding this staff, you have a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC increases by 1.

***Versatile.*** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Vestige of Divergence.*** *This item is a Vestige of Divergence, see *Tal'Dorei Treasures* for more information.*
