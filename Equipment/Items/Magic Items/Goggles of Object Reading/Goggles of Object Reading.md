#### Goggles of Object Reading

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

---

These leather-framed goggles feature purple crystal lenses. While wearing the goggles, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to reveal information about a creature or object you can see.

In addition, you can cast the *identify* spell using the googles. Once you do so, you can't do so again until the next dawn.
