The Icon of Ravenloft is a 12-inch tall statuette made of the purest silver, weighing 10 pounds. It depicts a cleric kneeling in supplication.

The icon was given to Strahd by the archpriest Ciril Romulich, an old family friend, to consecrate the castle and its chapel.

While within 30 feet of the icon, a creature is under the effect of a *protection from evil and good* spell against fiends and undead. Only a creature attuned to the icon can use its other properties.

***Augury.*** You can use an action to cast an *augury* spell from the icon, with no material components required. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Bane of the Undead.*** You can use the icon as a holy symbol while using the Turn Undead or Turn the Unholy feature. If you do so, increase the save DC by 2.

***Cure Wounds.*** While holding the icon, you can take an action to heal one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. The target regains 3d8 + 3 hit points, unless it is an undead, a construct, or a fiend. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
