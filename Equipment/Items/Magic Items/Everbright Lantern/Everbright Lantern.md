#### Everbright Lantern

Wondrous item, common

---

This bullseye lantern contains an Eberron dragonshard that sheds light comparable to that produced by a *continual flame* spell. An everbright lantern sheds light in a 120-foot cone; the closest 60 feet is bright light, and the farthest 60 feet is dim light.
