## Heavy Armor

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn't let you add your [[Dexterity]] modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your [[Dexterity]] modifier is negative.
