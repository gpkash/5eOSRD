#### Basic Fishing Equipment

Adventuring gear, 1 sp

---

Basic Fishing Equipment includes a pole, a line, a hook, and either a lure or some bait.

Fishing is a popular pastime in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, though this activity isn't possible aboard a ship that is moving faster than its flying speed. At the end of each hour spent fishing, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. A failed check indicates no fish is caught during that hour. On a successful check, roll a d10 and consult the Fishing table to determine the catch.
