#### Survival Mantle

Medium armor, 40 lb.

AC 15 + Dex (max 2)

---

This carapace-like augmentation encases portions of the wearer's shoulders, neck, and chest. A survival mantle is equivalent to a suit of nonmagical half plate armor and takes just as long to don or doff. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor.

A creature wearing a survival mantle can breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum) and has advantage on saving throws against harmful gases (such as those created by a *cloudkill* spell, a *stinking cloud* spell, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).

The wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
