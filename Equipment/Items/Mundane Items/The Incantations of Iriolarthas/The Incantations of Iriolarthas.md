#### The Incantations of Iriolarthas

Adventuring gear, 3 lb.

---

The Incantations of Iriolarthas is a weighty spellbook. Its black leather covers have dead, toothy worms glued to them, sheathed in glossy varnish. Set into this morbid display on the front cover is a gold rune that resembles a stylized eye with a pupil shaped like a candle flameâ€”the sigil of Iriolarthas, a Netherese lich.
