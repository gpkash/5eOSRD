#### Oloore Root Teabag

Illegal drug, 100 gp

---

This root is typically *sold in teabags* for 100 gp per dose. It was originally a ritualistic tool used by the followers of many gods, but now sees more recreational use. Oracles used it to enhance their divinations, for it helped them leave their physical bodies behind and become closer to gods and spirits. Drinking tea brewed from the root causes intense hallucinations, which feel like they have granted perfect clarity of mind to the imbiber.

After drinking *oloore tea* as an action, you must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or experience vivid hallucinations for 1d4 hours. During this time, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. If you fail the saving throw by 10 or more, your hallucinations become horrific visions and you gain a level of exhaustion. On a success, you gain preternatural clarity, allowing you to cast the *scrying* spell once within the next 1d4 hours.

*This item is an illegal drug; see Illegal Drugs for more information.*
