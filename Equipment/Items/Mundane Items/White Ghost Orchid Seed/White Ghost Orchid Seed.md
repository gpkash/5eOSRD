#### White Ghost Orchid Seed

Adventuring gear

More rarely, the orchids produce a smaller pod holding a single white seed. Among its various magical properties, if a white seed is ground and scattered over a dead body, the body is affected by the *resurrection* spell. A white ghost orchid seed has no effect if consumed.
