#### Dragon's Blood

Introduced into Sharn by Daask, dragon's blood is a potent and highly addictive stimulant. In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance spellcasting ability or even temporarily imbue a user with the ability to cast sorcerer spells. The drug's effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn't something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a *fireball* in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon's blood are up to you, but you can take inspiration from the Wild Magic Surge table in the *Player's Handbook*.
