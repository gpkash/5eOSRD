#### Wukka Nut

Adventuring gear, 1 gp

---

These fist-sized nuts grow on wukka trees, which are popular haunts for **jaculi**, **su-monsters**, and **zorbos**. A wukka nut rattles when shaken, causing its shell to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. This magical light fades after 1 minute, but shaking the nut again causes the light to reappear. If the shell of the nut is cracked open, it loses its magic.
