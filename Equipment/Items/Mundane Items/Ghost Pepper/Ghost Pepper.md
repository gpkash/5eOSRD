# Ghost Pepper (5e Equipment)


_Wondrous item, rare_Â 

This fist-sized pepper is bone white and slightly translucent. When eaten, make a DC 20 Con save; take 3d6 fire damage on a failed save and half as much on a success. For 5 minutes after eating, you may use a bonus action to breath fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target makes a DC 15 Dex save, taking 5d6 fire damage and becoming frightened of you until the end of your next turn on a failed save, and taking half as much damage on a success.
