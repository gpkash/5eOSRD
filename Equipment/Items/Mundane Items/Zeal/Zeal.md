#### Zeal

Illegal drug, 150 gp

---

Distilled from the ichor of demons, *zeal* was originally used by Tal'Dorei's ancient berserkers to grant them incredible strength and courage before battles. These days, it's most commonly used by criminal bruisers before a brawl. Most modern warriors stay well away from *zeal*, due both to its addictive nature and to the mental and physical degeneration it can cause over long periods of time. When prepared properly, *zeal* is a purple, ashy-tasting gel that typically costs 150 gp per dose.

After slathering *zeal* across your exposed skin as an action, you must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you become paralyzed for 1d4 rounds as your muscles lock up. On a success, your weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 damage for the next minute. After this effect ends, you gain one level of exhaustion.
