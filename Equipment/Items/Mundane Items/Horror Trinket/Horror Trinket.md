#### Horror Trinket

Adventuring gear

---

Before you finish making a character, roll once on the Horror Trinkets table for a unique object your character has with them at the start of their adventuring career. These trinkets hint toward various horrific tales and might lead to dreadful revelations or be nothing more than grim keepsakes. At the DM's discretion any of these trinkets might also be a Mist talisman (detailed in *chapter 3*), a focal item that can lead the bearer through the Mists to a particular Domain of Dread.
