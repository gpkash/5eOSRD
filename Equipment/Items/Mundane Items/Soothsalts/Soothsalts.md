#### Soothsalts

Adventuring gear, 150 gp

---

Soothsalts are derived from a naturally occurring crystalline substance. The crimson crystals have been mined from cavernous veins like those in the salt mines near the coast of Mere of Dead Men and found within smaller geode formations. Soothsalts are consumed orally in lozenge-sized doses, and frequent users can be identified by the telltale crimson stain around their mouths. A creature subjected to a dose of soothsalts gains advantage on all Intelligence checks for 1d4 hours.

For each dose of soothsalts consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustionâ€”an effect which is cumulative with multiple doses.
