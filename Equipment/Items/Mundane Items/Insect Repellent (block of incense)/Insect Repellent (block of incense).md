#### Insect Repellent (block of incense)

---

Insect repellent can be purchased in Port Nyanzaru in two forms: blocks of incense or a greasy salve. The merchant prince Kwayothe controls the sale of both. Neither kind of repellent protects against giant insects or the vile swarms of insects described in appendix A of the Monster Manual.

When lit, it burns for 8 hours and repels normal insects within a 20-foot-radius centered on it.
