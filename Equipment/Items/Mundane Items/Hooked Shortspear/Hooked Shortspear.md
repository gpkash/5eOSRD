On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

***Light.*** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
