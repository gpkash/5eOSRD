Purchasing a *skyship* costs 100,000 gp, and requires a personal connection with the Alsfarin Union in *Ank'Harel*. A *skyship* travels at a top speed of 10 miles per hour, can carry total cargo of 10 tons, and requires a crew of six to ten humanoids to operate at peak performance. Most *skyships* have maximum accommodations for up to 30 passengers. Most *skyships* only travel between existing skyports (see "*Emon Skyport*,"), and charge a fee of 2 gp per mile for a passenger ticket. Chartering a *skyship* to a destination off the standard sky routes costs 15 gp per mile, if the captain is available and willing to undertake the journey. Shipping cargo costs 1 gp per mile per 100 pounds of cargo along normal sky routes, and twice that to other destinations.

***Crew.*** A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to function. As per the Player's Handbook, one skilled hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of vessel.

You can track the loyalty of individual crew members or the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules in chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal during a voyage, the crew turns hostile and stages a mutiny. If the ship is berthed, disloyal crew members leave the ship and never return.

***Passengers.*** This indicates the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate.

Accommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight quarters. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers.

A passenger is usually expected to pay 5 sp per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 gp per day.

***Cargo.*** The maximum tonnage the ship can carry.

***Damage Threshold.*** If a ship has a Damage Threshold, it has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the ship's hit points.

***Ship Repair.*** Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labor.
