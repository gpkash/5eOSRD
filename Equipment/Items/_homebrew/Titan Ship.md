#### Titan Ship
_Wondrous item, artifact

**Crafted by:** Tarrasque Shell x1 (Artificer)

This ship's hull is formed from the shell of a tarrasque and shares much of its properties. The ship is 30 feet wide, 70 feet long, and 20 feet high. It possesses 3 sails and can travel at 2 Â½ mph in a good wind. The ship has 25 AC, 500 HP, can house 60 passengers, carry 200 tons of cargo and has a damage threshold of 20.

In addition, this ship is immune to fire damage as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. If the titan ship is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the ship is unaffected. On a 6, the ship is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the ship, turning the caster into the target.
