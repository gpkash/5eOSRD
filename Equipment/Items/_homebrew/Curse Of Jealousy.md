#### Curse Of Jealousy
_Wondrous item, rare_

**Crafted by:** Peryton Heart x1 (Thaumaturge)

This scroll contains blasphemous words written in a dark ink, that when read aloud can permanently alter the makeup of a magical object. You may spend 1 hour reading this scroll aloud while holding a magical item. At the end of that hour, that item permanently becomes a cursed item with a curse that reads as follows:
> Curse: "When you attune to this item you become cursed. As long as you remain cursed, you feel a strong need to be around this item at all times and become reluctant to be more than 5 feet away from it at any given time. In addition, whenever you attempt to give an item belonging to you to someone else, you must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. If you fail, you find yourself unable to give that item away and your action is wasted." This curse ends permanently on both the item and the afflicted creature if the remove curse spell or similar magic is cast on the cursed item.
