#### Gargoyle Wing Cloak
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Gargoyle Wing x2 (Artificer)

This leather-like cloak is made from the transfigured remains of a gargoyle's wings. When this cloak is placed on an inanimate object that is: made of stone, not fixed to anything, and no larger than 10 cubic feet in volume, the cloak transforms into a pair of gargoyle wings attached to that item for the next hour or until the item is destroyed.

While attached to the wings in this way, that item gains both a flying speed of 60 feet, and a low level of sentience causing it to follow the creature that placed the cloak over it until the effect ends. The enchanted item takes the most direct path to that creature, avoiding obstacles and obviously dangerous terrain. At the end of the hour, the item attempts to return safely to the ground and the wings transform back into a cloak. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
