#### Draco-Lich Censer
_Wondrous item, very rare_

**Crafted by:** Dracolich Bone x1 (Thaumaturge)

This censer has an innate connection with the draco-lich from whom it was crafted. When held by a creature, faint wisps of smoke will emerge and blow in the direction of that draco-lich if that draco-lich is still animate and on the same plane of existence as the holder. The intensity and thickness of the smoke will increase as proximity to the draco-lich decreases. A creature holding this item may also spend 10 minutes focusing on it, after which, a wisp of smoke will emerge and blow in the direction of the draco-lich's gemstone if it is on the same plane of existence as the censer. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
