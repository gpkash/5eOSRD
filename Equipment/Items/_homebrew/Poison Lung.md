#### Poison Lung
_Wondrous item, very rare_

**Crafted by:** Poison Canister x1 (Tinker)

This item resembles an iron cylinder attached to a leathery sack capable of being filled with air. While holding this item, you may spend an action to squeeze the sack to release a 15-foot cone of poisonous gas in front of you.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Once used, this item may not be used again for another 1d8 hours.
