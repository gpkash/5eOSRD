#### Curse Of Nightmares
_Wondrous item, rare_

**Crafted by:** Rakshasa Claw x1 (Thaumaturge)

This scroll contains blasphemous words written in a dark ink, that when read aloud can permanently alter the makeup of a magical object. You may spend 1 hour reading this scroll aloud while holding a magical item. At the end of that hour, that item permanently becomes a cursed item with a curse that reads as follows:
> Curse: "When you attune to this item you become cursed. As long as you remain cursed, you have a 20 per cent chance whenever you take a short or long rest to be wracked by terrible images and thoughts. When this occurs, you gain no benefit from finishing that short or long rest."

This curse ends permanently on both the item and the afflicted creature if the remove curse spell or similar magic
is cast on the cursed item.
