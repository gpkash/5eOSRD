#### Amulet Of The Mind Flayer
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Mind Flayer Heart x1 (Artificer)

While you are wearing this amulet, you may spend an action to designate up to 4 willing creatures within 30 feet of you as your thralls. So long as you and your thralls are on the same plane of existence, you may communicate with them telepathically.
In addition, so long as you and at least one of your thralls are within 30 feet of each other, you both gain advantage on Intelligence saving throws, and if you suffer psychic damage, you may spend your reaction to force your thrall to suffer some, or all of that damage instead of you. You may only have up to 4 creatures as your thralls at a time. If you wish to add a new creature, you must spend an action breaking your connection to one of your old ones first.

Curse: Using this amulet is a dangerous proposition due to its vile origins. Attuning to this amulet curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. While cursed, you automatically fail on saving throws imposed by members of the illithid race, including elder brains and intellect devourers.
