#### Sensory Collar
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Otyugh Telepathy Ganglia x1 (Tinker)

This collar, made from the same bundle of nerves that grant the brutish otyugh limited telepathy, grants beasts a similar ability. When worn by a beast with an Intelligence score of 6 or less, that beast may transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond, nor does it necessarily allow the receiving creature to understand a message that has been sent if it does not understand the language used by the beast (if any). As a whole, a beast will tend to send messages of emotions and non-verbal feelings rather than actual worded messages.
