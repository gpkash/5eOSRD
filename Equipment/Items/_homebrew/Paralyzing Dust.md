#### Paralyzing Dust
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Ghoul Claw xI, or Ghast Claw x1 (Alchemist)

You may spend an action to blow this pouch of grey dust into the face of a non-undead creature within 5 feet of you.

That creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. That creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on a success.

If this dust is dissolved into a liquid first and then drunk by a non-undead creature, they automatically fail the save and all subsequent saves for the next minute.
