#### Salamander Fire
_Oil, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Salamander Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)

This vial contains 3 doses. Chimera fire is a highly viscous oil that is incredibly flammable and yet strangely easy to control. You may spend an action to cover a melee weapon in a dose of this oil and set it alight. While on fire in this way, a weapon deals an extra 1d6 fire damage on a successful hit and also sheds bright light out to a distance of 10 feet and dim light for a further 10 feet. The weapon will continue to burn for 1 minute before extinguishing itself. Traditional methods of extinguishing the flame do not work unless they manage to take the oil itself off the melee weapon.
