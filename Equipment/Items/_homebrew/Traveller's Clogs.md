#### Traveller's Clogs
_Wondrous item, common_

**Crafted by:** Pegasus Hoof x2 (Artificer)

While wearing this pair of clogs, walking does not tire you as much. You are capable of walking 16 hours per day before being forced to make a Constitution saving throw against exhaustion. After 16 hours, you must succeed on Constitution saving throws again like normal at the end of each hour, with the DC set as 10 + 1, for each hour past 16 hours.
