#### Potion Of Sickness
_Potion, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Manes Vapour x1 vial (Alchemist)

When you drink this potion, you become sick with mane disease for 1d12 hours. While sick in this way, your nose becomes runny and your eyes watery, causing you to have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. However, your relatively mild sickness also boosts your immune system, giving you advantage on Constitution saving throws against being poisoned and other diseases.

This potion is a pale grey colour with a string of liquid in it that resembles watery mucus.
