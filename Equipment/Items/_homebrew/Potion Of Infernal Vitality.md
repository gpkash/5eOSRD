#### Potion Of Infernal Vitality
_Potion, very rare_

**Crafted by:** Pit Fiend Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)

When you drink this potion, you recover 8d4+8 hit points and you gain a fiendish constitution for the next 1d4 hours.

During this time, you gain resistance to cold, fire, and poison damage as well as damage from nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered. You also have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. This potion is a deep crimson and smells strongly of sulfur.
