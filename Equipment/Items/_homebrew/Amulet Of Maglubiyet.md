#### Amulet Of Maglubiyet
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Mark of Maglubiyet x1 (Thaumaturge)

While wearing this amulet, you gain the ability to spend your action and martial your allies with your resounding leadership. For 1 minute, you may utter a special command or warning whenever a non-hostile creature that you can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand you. A creature can benefit from only one of these effects at a time. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated.
