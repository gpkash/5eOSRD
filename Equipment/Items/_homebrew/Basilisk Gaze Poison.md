#### Basilisk Gaze Poison
_Poison, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Basilisk Eye x1 (Alchemist)

A creature that drinks this poison must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. While poisoned in this way, a creature magically turns to stone and is petrified. A creature remains petrified like this until either the 24 hours have passed, or until freed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.
