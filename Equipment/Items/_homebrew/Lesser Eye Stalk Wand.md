#### Lesser Eye Stalk Wand
_Wand, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Spectator Eye Stalk x2 (Artificer)

This wand has 5 charges. While holding this wand, you may spend an action and 1 charge to shoot a magical ray of energy at a target within 90 feet of you. The type of ray depends on the type of spectator eye stalk that the wand was crafted from. Consult the list below to find out what your wand does.
1. ﻿﻿﻿Confusion Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become unable to take reactions until the end of its next turn. On its turn, the target can't move, and it uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly determined creature within range. If the target can't attack, it does nothing on its turn.
2. ﻿﻿﻿Paralyzing Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
3. ﻿﻿﻿Fear Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the effect on itself on a success.
4. ﻿﻿﻿Wounding Ray. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When the last charge of this wand is used, it crumbles into dust and is destroyed.
