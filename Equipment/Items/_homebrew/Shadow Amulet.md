#### Shadow Amulet
_Wondrous item, rare_

**Crafted by:** Demonic Imprint x1 (Thaumaturge)

When you are holding this item, you may spend an action to summon a shadow demon in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you (refer to the Monster Manual for the relevant statblock). This shadow demon is friendly towards you and allies that you designate and obeys your commands. The shadow demon has access to all of its normal abilities and features and acts directly after your turn. The shadow demon disappears after 1 minute, if it drops to 0 hit points, you become unconscious, or if it ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the amulet.

Whenever the shadow demon is summoned, there is a 10 per cent chance that this item will instead shatter, releasing the shadow demon from the amulet and freeing it from your control. In this case, it rolls for initiative and acts on its own turn, and is unfriendly to any creature around it. It does not disappear unless it is reduced to 0 hit points.
