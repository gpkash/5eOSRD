_Potion, very rare_

**Crafted by:** Marilith Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)

When you drink this potion, you gain one reaction on every turn in a combat. This effect lasts for 1 minute, after which you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. This potion is completely clear except for one cloudy grey portion that darts around in the liquid towards anything holding the bottle.
