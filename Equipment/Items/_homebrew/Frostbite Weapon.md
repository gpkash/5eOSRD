#### Frostbite Weapon
_Weapon (any weapon that deals piercing damage), very rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Ice Devil Mandible x2 (Blacksmith)

You gain a +2 bonus to all attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit with this weapon, you may choose to deal an extra 3d6 cold damage and force the target creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, for the next minute the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet, is unable to take reactions, and only be able to take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the end of your next short rest. If you roll a 20 on attack roll with this weapon however, the ability may be used again at that time, regardless of if you used it recently or not.
