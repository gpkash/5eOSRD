#### Angel Robe
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Deva Skin (Leatherworker)

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this robe and all your weapon attacks are considered magical. In addition, you gain the ability to spend an action to polymorph yourself into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or lower than your character level, or back into your true form. You revert to your true form if you die or drop to 0 hit points. If the effect ends due to dropping to O hit points, any excess damage carries over to your true form. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (your choice).

In a new form, you retain your statistics and ability to speak, but your AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and you gain any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary action, and lair actions) that the new form has but that you lack.
