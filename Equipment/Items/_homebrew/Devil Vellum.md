#### Devil Vellum
_Wondrous item, rare_

**Crafted by:** Bone Devil Hide x1 (Leatherworker)

A wizard may choose to inscribe one of their known spells on this sheaf of vellum and insert it into their spellbook. If they do so, whenever they cast that spell, they may cast it as if they had cast it using the highest spell slot level their wizard level would grant them, regardless of the level of the spell slot they actually used. Whenever they cast that spell however, they have a 10 per cent chance of being transported to a random level of the Nine Hells for 1 minute, after which they return to the spot from which they disappeared, or the nearest unoccupied space.
