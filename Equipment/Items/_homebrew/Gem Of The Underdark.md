- For the next hour, you cannot become lost while travelling in the Underdark. You have advantage on any Wisdom (Survival) check made to locate something in the Underdark (1 charge).
- For the next hour, you gain a tremorsense and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet (2 charges).
- You and up to 4 willing creatures within 30 feet of you, teleport to a random unoccupied location in the Underdark, if you were not already in the Underdark.
