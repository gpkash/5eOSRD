#### Potion Of The Sahuagin
_Potion, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Sahuagin Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)

This potion uses a sahuagin's blood as a base along with various seaweeds, seashells, and fish scales to produce a mutagenic effect in those who drink it. For the next 10 minutes after drinking this potion, you gain the following benefits:
- A swim speed equal to your move speed.
- The ability to breathe in both air and water.
- Advantage on any melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.

When you drink this potion, you must also succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or undergo a permanent mutation into a sahuagin. As a sahuagin, you lose all of your previous racial traits and instead gain a swim speed of 40 ft., the blood frenzy, limited amphibiousness, and shark telepathy traits from the sahuagin's statblock, and your alignment changes to lawful evil. This mutation can only be cured by a greater restoration spell or similar magic.
