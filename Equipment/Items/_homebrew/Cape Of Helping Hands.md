#### Cape Of Helping Hands
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Marilith Spine x1 (Leatherworker)

This leather cape is formed from two enchanted sheets of leather, connected to a repurposed marilith spine running down the centre.

While wearing this cape, you may speak the command word as an action to animate the two sheets of leather which detach from the spine and form an extra set of arms and hands. You may control these arms and hands as if they were your own free hands, and they have a reach, strength, and dexterity equal to your regular arms and hands. You do not gain any extra attacks, and the rules for two-weapon fighting remain unchanged.

These extra hands remain for 1 hour or until you dismiss them by repeating the command word as an action. When they disappear, they cannot be used again for the next 1d6 hours.
