#### Drone Producer
_Wondrous item, rare_

**Crafted by:** Chasme Wing x2 (Tinker)

This palm sized box is packed with the harvested remains of a chasme's wings. You may spend an action winding the crank on the side, after which, this item produces a horrid droning sound to which demons are immune. Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of this item must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. A creature that can't hear the drone automatically succeeds on the save.

The effect on the creature ends if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to splash it with holy water. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, it is immune to this item for the next 24 hours.

Every time this item is used, there is a 25 per cent chance that the internal mechanism will break, rendering it useless.
