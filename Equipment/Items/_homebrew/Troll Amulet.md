#### Troll Amulet
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Troll Heart x1 (Artificer)

This amulet contains the crystallised form of a troll heart preserved in tar. While wearing and attuned to this amulet, you may spend an action to activate it. For the next minute, you regain 10 hit points at the start of your turn so long as you haven't taken acid or fire damage since the end of your last turn and so long as you start your turn with at least 1 hit point.

Once you have used this ability once, you cannot use it again until the next dawn.
