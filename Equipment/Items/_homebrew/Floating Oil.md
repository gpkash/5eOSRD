#### Floating Oil
_Oil, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Gas Spore Gas x1 vial (Alchemist)

When this oil is rubbed into an item that weighs 20 pounds or less, that item becomes lighter than air for the next hour.

It retains all of its other characteristics, but it automatically rises unless appropriate downward force is applied to it. If this oil is applied to an item that weighs more than 20 pounds, it takes no effect and the oil is wasted.
