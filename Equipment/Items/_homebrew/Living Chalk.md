#### Living Chalk
_Wondrous item, common_

**Crafted by:** Enchanted Pumice x1 (Alchemist)

Images drawn by this chalk are capable of small amounts of movement on their drawing surface, resembling a basic flipbook animation. These images tend to act in a manner imagined by the creature that drew them but are otherwise unaware of their surroundings and cannot move more than 1 foot beyond their original placement. These drawings lose their enchantment and freeze into place 10 minutes after being drawn.
