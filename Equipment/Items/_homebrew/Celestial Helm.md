#### Celestial Helm
_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Solar Eye x2 (Artificer)

This helm has 9 charges and regains 1d8 charges at dawn.

While wearing this helm, you spend an action to expend 1 or more charges to do any of the following:
- You, and any equipment you are wearing or carrying, teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. (1 charge)
- You emit a magical, divine energy. Each creature of your choice in a 10-foot radius centered on yourself must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage plus 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. (1 charges)
- You target one creature you can see within 30 feet. If the target can see, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until magic such as the lesser restoration spell removes the blindness. (2 charges)
- You release your held melee weapon to hover magically in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If you can see the melee weapon, you can mentally command it as a bonus action to fly up to 50 feet and either make one attack against a target or return to your hands. If the hovering sword is targeted by any effect, you are considered to be holding it. The hovering weapon falls if you die or take off the helmet. Otherwise, this effect lasts for 1 minute. This ability may only be used on one melee weapon at a time, any attempt to use it on another while one is already under its effect causes the original one to fall to the ground. (2 charges)
