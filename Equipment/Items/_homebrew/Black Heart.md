#### Black Heart
_Wondrous item, very rare_

**Crafted by:** Death Knight Heart x1 (Thaumaturge)

This item has an intrinsic link with the death knight from whom it was crafted. When held by a creature, it will beat when faced in the direction of that death knight if that death knight is still animate and on the same plane of existence as the holder. The frequency and intensity of its beats will also increase the closer it is to its death knight.
