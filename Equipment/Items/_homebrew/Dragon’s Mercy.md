#### Dragonâ€™s Mercy
_Wondrous item, rarity varies_

**Crafted by:** Wyrmling Secondary Dragon Breath Pouch x1 (uncommon), or Young Secondary Dragon Breath Pouch x1 (rare), or Adult Secondary Dragon Breath Pouch x1 (rare), or Ancient Secondary Dragon Breath Pouch x1 (legendary) (Alchemist)

This leathery pouch is repurposed from a dragon's secondary breath pouch and has had some of its potency reduced in exchange for long term usability. While holding this item, you may spend an action to squeeze the bag, creating an effect identical to the non-damaging breath weapon of the dragon from whom this item was crafted (refer to the Monster Manual for the exact stats).

Once this item has been used once, it cannot be used again for 1d4 hours.
