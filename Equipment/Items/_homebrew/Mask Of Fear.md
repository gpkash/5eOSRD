#### Mask Of Fear
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Chain Devil Eye x2 (Artificer)

When a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you while you are wearing this mask, you can create the illusion that you look like one of the creature's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature can see you, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its turn.

Once you have used this ability once, it cannot be used again until you finish a short rest.
