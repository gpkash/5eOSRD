# Dresdtinn's Grimoire: Recipes for the Alchemical Art

## Recipes

### Common

#### Soothsalts

Soothsalts are derived from a naturally occurring crystalline. Soothsalts are consumed orally in lozenge-sized doses, and frequent users can be identified by the telltale crimson stain around their mouths. A creature subjected to a dose of soothsalts gains advantage on all Intelligence checks for 1d4 hours.

For each dose of soothsalts consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion—an effect which is cumulative with multiple doses.

Soothsalts may be worth as much as 150 gp to the right buyer, but is often illegal to trade.

Ingredients: Soothsalt Geode

#### Bottled Breath

This bottle contains a breath of elemental air. When you inhale it, you either exhale it or hold it.

If you exhale the breath, you gain the effect of the gust of wind spell. If you hold the breath, you don’t need to breathe for 1 hour, though you can end this benefit early (for example, to speak). Ending it early doesn’t give you the benefit of exhaling the breath.

Ingredients: Air elemental wisp
