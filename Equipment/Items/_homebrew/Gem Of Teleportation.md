#### Gem Of Teleportation
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Yugoloth Heart x1 (Artificer)

This gem has 5 charges. While holding this gem, you may spend your action and 1 charge in order to teleport yourself and any equipment you are wearing or carrying up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. This gem regains 1d4+1 charges at dawn.

Alternatively, you may use 5 charges to cast the spell plane shift through the gem with the plane of Gehenna as your destination. If used in this way, the gem dissolves into a useless black ichor and is destroyed.
