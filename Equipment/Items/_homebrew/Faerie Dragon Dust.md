#### Faerie Dragon Dust
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Faerie Dragon Wing x1 (Alchemist)

You may spend an action to sprinkle some of this dust over yourself. If you do so, you magically turn invisible as if under the effect of the invisibility spell (no concentration required). This pouch contains enough dust for three sprinkles.
