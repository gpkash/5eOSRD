#### Shadowflame Oil
_Oil, rare_

**Crafted by:** Shadowflame Ember x1 vial (Alchemist)

The oil in this vial can be used to coat up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing weapon. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For the next 10 minutes, any creature successfully hit by this weapon or ammunition takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. If this weapon or ammunition kills a creature, a shadow under your control rises from that corpse (refer to the Monster Manual for the relevant statblock). This shadow acts directly after you in the initiative count and disappears after 1 hour or if it or you fall unconscious.
