#### Lens Of Insight
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Nothic Eye x1 (Artificer)

While wearing this lens, you may target one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested against the target's Charisma (Deception).

If you win, you magically learn one fact or secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to being charmed.

Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
