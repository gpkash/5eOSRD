#### Hand Of Undeath
_Wondrous item, uncommon_

**Crafted by:** Wight Hand x1 (Thaumaturge)

You may place the heart of a humanoid that has died within the last 24 hours into this hand. The hand then squeezes tightly over this heart, which quickly decays and withers away over the course of 1 minute. Once the heart has fully withered away, you gain 5 temporary hit points that last until you finish your next long rest.
