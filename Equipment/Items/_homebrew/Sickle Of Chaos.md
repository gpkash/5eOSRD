#### Sickle Of Chaos
_Weapon (sickle), rare (requires attunement)_

**Crafted by:** Blue Slaad Claw x1 (Blacksmith)

This wicked scythe continues to carry the chaotic, but fair, energies of Limbo inherit in all slaadi. You gain +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you make an attack against a creature with this weapon, you may choose to do so at disadvantage. If your attack is successful, the creature you attacked also has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. This ability cannot be used if you were to already attack at disadvantage.
