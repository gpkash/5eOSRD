_Weapon (any melee bludgeoning weapon), very rare (requires attunement by a good-aligned paladin or cleric)_

**Crafted by:** Planetar Bone x1 (Thaumaturge)

You gain a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit an attack using this weapon, the target takes an additional 1d6 radiant damage.

While holding this weapon, you may also spend an action to hold this weapon above your head, causing you to emanate a holy aura for the next 10 minutes. This aura is a cylinder 20 feet high and with a 10-foot radius centered on where you used this ability. Any fiend or undead within this aura may not willingly leave by any means unless they first succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. In addition, any fiend that dies within this aura acts as if it died on its native plane. Once this ability has been used once, it may not be used again until the next dawn.
