#### Cloud Step Oil
_Oil, very rare_

**Crafted by:** Cloud Giant Blood x1 vial (Alchemist)

When some of this oil is poured out, it immediately has a reaction to the air around it and magically expands into a semi-solid cloud that is capable of floating while holding weight on top of it. Up to 50 pounds of weight per square foot can be placed on one of these clouds. If more weight than this is placed on it, that section of cloud disappears instantly. Clouds are self-supporting in the air but can also be used to make structures such as bridges using careful placement of the oil Clouds weigh virtually nothing and can be moved around if external force is applied to them.

The clouds last for 1 hour after pouring, after which they disappear. One bottle of this oil is enough to create 500 square feet of clouds.
