#### Demilich Censer
_Wondrous item, very rare_

**Crafted by:** Demilich Smoke x1 vial (Thaumaturge)

This censer has an innate connection with the demilich from whom it was crafted. When held by a creature, faint wisps of smoke will emerge and blow in the direction of that demilich if that demilich is still animate and on the same plane of existence as the holder. The intensity and thickness of the smoke will increase as proximity to the demilich decreases.

A creature holding this item may also spend 10 minutes focusing on it, after which, a wisp of smoke will emerge and blow in the direction of the demilich's phylactery if it is on the same plane of existence as the censer. Once this ability has been used once, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
