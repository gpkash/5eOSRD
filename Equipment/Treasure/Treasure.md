# Treasure

Adventurers strive for many things including glory, knowledge, and justice.

Many adventurers also seek something more tangible: fortune. Strands of golden chains, stacks of platinum coins, bejeweled crowns, enameled scepters, bolts of silk cloth, and powerful [[Magic Items]] all wait to be seized or unearthed by intrepid, treasure-seeking adventurers.

This chapter details [[Magic Items]] and the placement of treasure in an adventure, as well as special rewards that can be granted instead of or in addition to [[Magic Items]] and mundane treasure.

## Types of Treasure

Treasure comes in many forms.

**Coins.** The most basic type of treasure is money, including copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), electrum pieces (ep), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp).

Fifty coins of any type weigh 1 pound.

**Gemstones.** [[Gemstones]] are small, lightweight, and easily secured compared to their same value in coins.

See the "[[Gemstones]]" section for types of stones, gems, and jewels that can be found as treasure.

**Art Objects.** Idols cast of solid gold, necklaces studded with precious stones, paintings of ancient kings, bejeweled dishes -[[Art Objects]] include all these and more. See the "[[Art Objects]]" section for types of decorative and valuable artworks that can be found as treasure.

**Magic Items.** Types of [[Magic Items]] include armor, potions, scrolls, rings, rods, staffs, wands, weapons, and wondrous items. [[Magic Items]] also have rarities: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary.

Intelligent monsters often use [[Magic Items]] in their possession, while others might hide them away to ensure they don't get lost or stolen. For example, if a [[Hobgoblin]] tribe has a +1 longsword and an alchemy jug in its treasure hoard, the tribe's warlord might wield the sword, while the jug is kept somewhere safe.

## Random Treasure

The following pages contain tables that you can use to randomly generate treasures carried by monsters, stashed in their lairs, or otherwise hidden away. The placement of treasure is left to your discretion. The key is to make sure the players feel rewarded for playing, and that their characters are rewarded for overcoming dangerous challenges.

### Treasure Tables

Treasure can be randomly allocated based on a monster's challenge rating. There are tables for challenge rating 0-4, challenge rating 5-10, challenge rating 11-16, and challenge rating 17 and higher. Use these tables to randomly determine how much money an individual monster carries (the D&D equivalent of pocket change) or the amount of wealth found in a larger treasure hoard.

#### Using the Individual Treasure Tables

An Individual Treasure table helps you randomly determine how much treasure one creature carries on its person. If a monster has no interest in amassing treasure, you can use this table to determine the incidental treasure left behind by the monster's victims.

Use the Individual Treasure table that corresponds to the monster's challenge rating. Roll a d100, and read the result across to determine how many coins of each type the monster carries. The table also includes the average result in parentheses, should you wish to forgo another roll and save time. To determine the total amount of individual treasure for a group of similar creatures, you can save time by rolling once and multiplying the result by the number of creatures in the group.

If it doesn't make sense for a monster to carry a large pile of coins, you can convert the coins into [[Gemstones]] or art objects of equal value.

#### Using the Treasure Hoard Tables

A [[Random Treasure Tables|Treasure Hoard table]] helps you randomly determine the contents of a large cache of treasure, the accumulated wealth of a large group of creatures (such as an [[Orc]] tribe or a [[Hobgoblin]] army), the belongings of a single powerful creature that likes to hoard treasure (such as a dragon), or the reward bestowed upon a party after completing a quest for a benefactor. You can also split up a treasure hoard so that the adventurers don't find or receive it all at once.

When determining the contents of a hoard belonging to one monster, use the table that corresponds to that monster's challenge rating. When rolling to determine a treasure hoard belonging to a large group of monsters, use the challenge rating of the monster that leads the group. If the hoard belongs to no one. use the challenge rating of the monster that presides over the dungeon or lair you are stocking. If the hoard is a gift from a benefactor, use the challenge rating equal to the party's average level.

Every treasure hoard contains a random number of coins, as shown at the top of each table. Roll a d100 and consult the table to determine how many [[Gemstones]] or art objects the hoard contains, if any. Use the same roll to determine whether the hoard contains [[Magic Items]].

As with the [[Random Treasure Tables|individual treasure tables]], average values are given in parentheses. You can use an average value instead of rolling dice to save time.

If a treasure hoard seems too small, you can roll multiple times on the table. Use this approach for monsters that are particularly fond of amassing treasure. Legendary creatures that accumulate treasure are wealthier than normal. Always roll at least twice on the appropriate table and add the results together.

You can hand out as much or as little treasure as you want. Over the course of a typical campaign. a party finds treasure hoards amounting to seven rolls on the Challenge 0-4 table, eighteen rolls on the Challenge 5-10 table, twelve rolls on the Challenge 11-16 table, and eight rolls on the Challenge 17+ table.
