There are regional and seasonal variations, each with family variations. Lightly alcoholic, Berry is usually drunk to refresh rather than to intoxicate (though in quantity, this the latter can be accomplished). Some varieties are dry, but most versions are at least slightly sweet, and almost all ideally have a light carbonation. A few variations made for sale to humans are sweeter and heavier, and are used as a kind of dessert wine, but most native drinkers turn up their nose at these.                                                                                                | The consumer is refreshed, energized and, usually, somewhat cheered. It intoxicates like a standard lager, and takes at least a pint to get the average halfling buzzed -- a good few pints for a typical human, and a dwarf or half-orc would need more. The varieties made for humans are stronger-- like a light wine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 1 Silver                                                                                     |

To drink it successfully requires a Constitution Save DC of 18. Failure to meet this immediately puts the consumer into a state of complete agony where they temporarily suffer moderate to large penalties to all attributes depending on how cruel the GM feels like being (and probably how much they tried to drink) and also take physical damage based on how badly they failed. They also gain the Weakened or Petrified condition. If they succeeded in taking the drink, they gain a +10 bonus to Constitution, Strength and Intelligence and also a temporary immunity to fire and poisons whose duration is based on how successful their roll is. (Duration capped at 48 hours.)
