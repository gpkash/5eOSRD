## Elven Food

### Vegetables (eaten raw, sometimes diced and fried with herbs and other vegetables):
- Cress
- Leek (also chives, hotwhips [spring onions], searshoots [wild Faerûnian vine onions]: These last are a staple of elven cuisine, and if left to dry until fall, can grow as hot as garlic, but never give elves "garlic breath")
- Parsley
- Coushoots (the green, growing "new" shoots of certain forest vines, such as Chokevine and Thaelthorn)
- Greenspear (asparagus, a staple with many elves, both raw and steamed with herbs)
- Various ferns, from fiddleheads to stewed broadleaves
- Brownbuds (brown Faerûnian wild forest radishes)

### Fruits:
- Many sorts of berries
- Rhubarb
- Roseapple (a mild-flavored apple-like fruit that grows at the thorny junctures of a particular sort of forest vine, the "rosethorn," that grows abundantly in the Heartlands)
- Aelfengrape Fruit (A handful of these provides the nourishment equivalent to an entire meal - see Dragon Magazine #357)

### Soups (usually served cold):
- Leek
- Turtle
- Blalatha (certain mushrooms, diced and then boiled)
- Darblalatha (certain mushrooms, diced, then fried with leeks, and then the mixed result is boiled)
- Haendur (simmered glow worms, seasoned with particular sharp-tasting leaves)
- Blackbark (literally, the stewed bark of four or five different sorts of forest bushes; tastes and looks a little like a thick beef stew)
- Snake (four sorts, beheaded and then boiled until skins separate from flesh; skins, like heads, are discarded)

### Meat and Fish Dishes (some elves eat flesh, some do not):
- Seared Rabbit
- Thaenwing (spiced-and-diced grouse, partridge, quail, and woodguth [wild turkey]; most elves are revolted at the thought of eating owls, whom they deem "intelligent souls," and believe dining on raptors brings misfortune on oneself and one's kin)
- Silvereyes (fish stew, of silverflash and other small forest stream fish)
- Sornstag (roasted hotspice (equivalent of curried) venison)
- Surkyl (beaver: belly-slashed to insert leek and herbs, then rolled in clay and fire-baked, to remove hide and quills with hardened mud shell) 
- Hooroun (moose, always marinated with particular herbs to counteract the natural seasonal tastes of spruce in winter and spring (when moose have been eating evergreen tips) and swamp in summer and fall (when moose have been grazing on swamp vegetation))
- Lulleth (muskrat and equivalents (from shrews and voles to "branchcats," which are a tree-climbing Faerûnian cross between a mink and a raccoon), usually simmered into a thick stew; most elves dislike boar, but when they do eat it, treat it in this same way)
- Groundsnake (beheaded and roasted on skewers over a fire)

### Trail Food:
- Various nuts and dried berries
- Mintnut cheese
- Taece (fire-dried tiny forest-stream fish, that look a little like brown, finger-length sardines, contain a lot of fat, and are "crunched" (eaten whole, bones and all))
- Marruth (sometimes disparagingly called "root pies" by dwarves and humans): pastries into which cooked spiced and herbed mashes of vegetables have been baked, and then let cool, and then rolled into rallow leaves (heavy, oily, waterproof broadleaves) to keep them from rotting, and carried for eating cold when on the move

### Desserts:
- Mint jelly
- Tarts made of various berries, sweetened with a mash of berry juices 

### Quaffs/Slakes (non-alcoholic):
- Sprucebark quaff (cleanses palate/freshens breath before meals and after)
- Mintwater
- Various berry-juice drinks (unfermented)
