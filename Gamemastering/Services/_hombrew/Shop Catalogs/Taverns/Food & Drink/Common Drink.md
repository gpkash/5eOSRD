# Common Drink

I am going to list these by type. The player's handbook doesn't give prices for all different types of booze, so use your own judgement.

## Cheap Stuff (5 cp / mug)

- Grog (rum with water, maybe with lemon or lime)
- Dregs and water ("dregs" are defined as the sediment in a liquid, such as wine or coffee)
- Goblin spit ale
- Orc Kragg: Very powerful, nauseates non-goblinoids. Popular among orcs and goblinoids. (Arms & Equipment Guide page 31)
- Goblin Thudrud: Has the "taste and smell of a rotting cow that caught fire." Goblinoids and some barbarians like it.
- Turnip wine
- Miller’s moonshine

## Ale (4 sp / mug)

- Dwarven ale
- Pulsch Brown Ale: Halflings make this. It has a pleasant, nutty flavor. (Arms & Equipment Guide page 31)

- Trollbane ale

## Wine (common, 2 sp / pitcher)

## Fine Wine (10 gp / bottle)
