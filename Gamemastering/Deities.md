These are the deities for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, which mostly are printed in the Appendix section of the 2014 5th edition _Players Handbook_. These include the deities from the [Forgotten Realms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgotten_Realms "Forgotten Realms"), [Greyhawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyhawk "Greyhawk"), [Dragonlance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonlance "Dragonlance"), [Eberron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberron "Eberron"), and the deities derived from historical pantheons such as the [Celtic deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_deities "Celtic deities") and [Norse deities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_deities "Norse deities"). The historical deities have been removed from their historical aspect as to better serve the needs of the game.

The 2014 5th edition _Dungeon Master's Guide_ later provided the "Dawn War Deities" as a sample pantheon, an updated version of the main pantheon of 4th edition. These updates included readjusting some of the alignments, because 5th edition returned to the previous schema of nine alignments, as well as adding suggested cleric domains of the available domains from the _PHB_ and _DMG_.

The _[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Coast_Adventurer%27s_Guide "Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide")_ from 2015 then gave a more detailed overview of all the deities from the Forgotten Realm, including nonhuman deities. A more detailed and expanded overview of nonhuman deities was printed in the 2018 _[Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordenkainen%27s_Tome_of_Foes "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes")_.
