### Vervain
Uncommon, Incence

This purple plant has pale purple flowers that are said to be able to ward off evil spirits. When burned in a fire or censor, it emits smoke in a 20-foot radius centered on the fire for an amount of time based on its potency. While a creature is within the smoke, everything outside the smoke is lightly obscured and they can't be [[charmed]], [[frightened]], or possessed by fiends and undead for 10 minutes, 1 hour, or 4 hours. You can move slowly each round if you are burning this in a censor. If you move faster than 10 feet, the smoke cloud can not keep up and the smoke dissipates. It takes 1 round before the smoke creates its protective barrier.
