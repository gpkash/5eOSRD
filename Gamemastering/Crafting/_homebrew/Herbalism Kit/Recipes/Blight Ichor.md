#### Blight Ichor
Rare, Potion

This bitter chartreuse concoction is distilled from a fungus native to the Blightshore badlands. The sickly green liqueur harbors potent psychedelic properties. Provided it is neither a construct nor undead, a creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on [[Intelligence]] and [[Wisdom]] checks, as well as [[vulnerability]] to psychic damage, for 1/2/3 hour(s). 

For each dose of blight ichor consumed, the creature must succeed on a DC [[Constitution]] saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1/3/6 hours and suffer the effects of a [[confusion|confusion spell]] for 1 minute. Save DC is dependent on potency: DC 13, DC 15, or DC 18. An undead creature subjected to a dose of blight ichor gains advantage on all [[Dexterity]] checks and is immune to the [[frightened]] condition for 1/3/6 hours.
