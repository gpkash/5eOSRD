### Sickening Rot
Very Rare, Edible

Mixing rotting flesh with mold growing from dwarven ale creates a bizarre mixture that is delightful as much as it is putrid. When ingested, the target must make a [[Constitution]] saving throw or find themselves drunk and incredibly sick at the same time, with disadvantage on [[Constitution]] saving throws and [[ability checks]]. This mixture tastes like meat rotted for several years in a pickling solution with a slight hint of berries. To force feed someone this mixture, they must be [[grappled]], [[restrained]], or [[incapacitated]] in some way. It then requires an action and a successful grapple check to force feed them the concoction.

The [[Constitution]] DC is dependent on potency: DC 15, DC 18, or DC 20. They can repeat the saving throw once every 10 minutes to end the effect early.
