### Drunk Legs
Rare, Potion

These pine needles are blended with a mixture of algae and muck to create a tonic that will leave muscles twitching.

Mixing this with a drink creates a vile tasting concoction that when ingested causes muscles to weaken and to not respond to commands from the body. When ingested, the target must succeed on a [[Constitution]] saving throw or have disadvantage on [[Dexterity]] saving throws and [[ability checks]] for 1 hour. To force feed someone this mixture, they must be [[grappled]], [[restrained]], or [[incapacitated]] in some way. It then requires an action and a successful grapple check to force feed them the concoction.

Save DC is dependent on potency: DC 13, DC 15, or DC 18. They can repeat the saving throw once every 10 minutes to end the effect early.
