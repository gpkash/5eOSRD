#### Vampiric Essence
Very Rare, Potion

This potions is amongst the most difficult to brew. Small mistakes can result in a poisonous or just horribly bitter concoction. If brewed correctly, however, this violently sour and vibrant green potion can be lifesaving in the right hands. For 1 minute after drinking it, 1/5th of all piercing, slashing or bludgeoning damage dealt by the drinker is absorbed and used to restore the drinkerâ€™s own hitpoints.
