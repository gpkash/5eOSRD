### Weakening Muscle
Rare, Ointment

Finely shredded mushrooms that turn to goo when worked with. You can then use that goo to smear it on a weapon and coat the weapon. On your next successful attack roll, the target must make a Strength saving throw or have disadvantage on Strength saving throws and ability checks for the next hour as the goo-like consistency makes the muscles shaky and unsteady.

Strength DC is dependent on potency: DC 13, DC 15, or DC 18. They can repeat the saving throw once every 10 minutes to end the effect early.
