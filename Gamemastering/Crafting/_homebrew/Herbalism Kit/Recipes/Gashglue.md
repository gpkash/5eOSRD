### Gashglue
Common, Ointment

This thick gray glue takes a full minute to apply to the bare skin. The glue temporarily holds damaged tissue together for up to 4 hours, at which point it dries up and flakes off. If applied within 10 minutes of receiving any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can spend an action to apply and gain 1d4 plus Wisdom modifier, 2d4 plus Wisdom modifier, or 3d4 plus Wisdom modifier temporary hit points.

If the temporary hit points exceeds the damage taken, you regain only up to the damage taken, not beyond.
