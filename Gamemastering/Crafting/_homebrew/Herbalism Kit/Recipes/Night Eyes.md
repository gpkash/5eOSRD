### Night Eyes
Uncommon, Ointment

As an action, this thick, greasy gel can be applied to the naked eye, granting [[5eOSRD/Gamemastering/Senses/Darkvision|darkvision]] of 60 feet. Duration is dependent on potency.

The eyes become extremely sensitive to light for the duration. While exposed to bright light, the user has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on [[Wisdom]] ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight. This has no effect on those that already have [[5eOSRD/Gamemastering/Senses/Darkvision|darkvision]].

When applied, Night Eyes lasts for 1 hour, 3 hours or 8 hours depending on potency.
