#### Potion of Revival
Rare, Potion

An entirely opaque, black potion with a point of light hanging in the middle. Drinking this potion has no effect on live people, but when poured down the throat of a person who died within a minute of administration it revives them, returning them to 1 HP. This does not work if they died of old age nor can it repair any missing body parts.
