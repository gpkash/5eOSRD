### Relaxing Bark
Uncommon, Incense

Upon burning a certain type of bark & moss in a censor, or by throwing it into the coals of a fire, all those within 10 feet of the smoke find their muscles loosen and their minds relax.

Anyone that allows themselves to relax, and take a short rest, for the hour that the bark burns for automatically regains a number of spent hit dice, but they must remain within 10 feet of the smoke for the full hour to gain this benefit. They can only regain hit dice if they spend hit dice during the short rest.

They regain 1, 2 or 3 spent hit dice depending on potency.
