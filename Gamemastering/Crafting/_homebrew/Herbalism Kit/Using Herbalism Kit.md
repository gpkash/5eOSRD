# Using Herbalism Kits

Proficiency with an herbalism kit allows you to identify both magical and nonmagical plants and safely collect their useful elements, and to create healing salves, potions, and tinctures.

## Contents
A herbalism kit includes three pouches to store herbs, clippers and leather gloves for collecting plants, a mortar and pestle, and five glass jars.

Characters with proficiency in the [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Items/Mundane Items/Herbalism Kit/Herbalism Kit|Herbalism Kit]] know 3 recipes and may be able to learn new recipes if they can find other herbalist, herbalist notes, or by experimenting with different plants in their environment.

## Skill Checks
If you have proficiency in herbalism kits, you can use your tool proficiency to give yourself advantage on certain skill checks.

### Arcana
Your knowledge of nature and uses of herbs can add insight to your magical studies that deal with plant creatures and your attempts to identify potions.

### Investigation
When you inspect an area overgrown with plants, your proficiency bonus can help you pick out details and clues that others might miss.

### Medicine
Your mastery of herbalism improves your ability to treat illnesses and wounds by augmenting your methods of care with medicinal plants.

### Nature / Survival
You can identify most plants with a quick inspection of their appearance, smell, and their surrounding environment. You can harvest the plant in such a way that isn't dangerous to you and provides useful ingredients.
