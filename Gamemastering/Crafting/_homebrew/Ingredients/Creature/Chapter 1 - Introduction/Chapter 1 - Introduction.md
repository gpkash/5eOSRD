# Chapter 1: Introduction

> *Welcome dear reader to Hamund's Harvesting Handbook, written by none other than I, Hamund Holderhek! But who am I you ask?*
>
> *Well, I am an adventurer at heart, a writer by passion, and a harvester at trade. I have travelled the many planes of the multiverse in search of adventure and story (for more of those stories, pick up any copy of "Hamund's Harrowing Histories I-XXXV).*
>
> *Through my life I have fought and defeated just about every kind of creature you can imagine: I have tussled with treants, skirmished with sphinxes, and even engaged in fisticuffs with a fomorian or two. Never being one to let something go to waste, I always took my trusty hunting knife to these creatures and had a look to see what they had to offer. I have spent many years writing down my findings and anecdotes, and I now present them to you less seasoned adventurers so you may soak in my wisdom.*
>
> *Yes, what you hold in your hands right now is a helpful guide to harvesting the creatures that a typical adventurer may face. You'll learn not just how valuable a roc's guts are, but also which way to twist your knife in order to extract them. The natural world is filled with riches just waiting for bold people like us to take them!*
>
> *Good luck and good harvesting,*

-Sir Hamund Holderhek, O.B.H. (First Class), V.A., N.K.P.

## Aim of this Guild
Let's be honest, every Dungeon Master has faced this exact problem at least once: their players have just finished killing a fearsome monster, and their first reaction is to slice it apart for loot. Now there's nothing wrong with this of course, but it can be a bit harrowing for a DM to not just come up with useful monster parts on the spot, but to also provide an interesting description, a monetary value, and a use for that part.

This book aims to act as a handy reference for the DM's that find themselves in this very situation. It provides a loot table for every single unique monster in the 5th Edition Monster Manual. These loot tables are easy to reference and contain every piece of information your players could need when they tear their fresh kills apart. It also possesses over 200 new and unique craftable items to be made from your harvesting adventures, and all the information you would need for them. There are of course rules for both the harvesting and the crafting, and a few extra goodies strewn in here too.

Everything has been written with balance in mind, but you are of course free to rebalance anything in this guide to suit your own table, or feel free to message me at driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com or hit me up on Twitter @drifterworkshop to discuss anything in this guide.
