| 10  | Cloaker Tooth (small pouch) | Resembling the needle-like teeth of a moray eel but stronger, the teeth of the cloaker can be used to make a variety of tools. Some of the more notorious thieves in the world even boast possessing lockpick sets made entirely of cloaker teeth.                                                                                                                                                                      | 5 gp   | 2 lb.  | -                           | 
| 15  | Cloaker Tail                | The infamous cloaker tail, covered in dozens of razor sharp spines. Drow taskmasters have developed a technique of taking the tails, treating them with special oils, and reusing them as whips.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 85 gP  | 20 lb. | Whip +1 (DMG)               |
| 20  | Cloaker Hide                | Even for the most experienced of tanners, the skin of the cloaker is exceptionally difficult to remove. Due to the cloaker's unique physiology, a single misplaced cut can cause the creature's internal enzymes to spill and stain the hide. If done correctly however, the skin will maintain its shadowy and illusive appearance and may be used as the foundation for the ever useful cloak of displacement. | 500 gP | 25 lb. | Cloak of Displacement (DMG) |
