| DC  | Item           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Value | Weight | Crafting                         |

| 5   | Chitin         | Extremely hard, but too unwieldy and unconfortable to use in making armour. The ankheg's hide still finds some uses as a building material, especially for subterranean dwellers who appreciate its suitability to rocky environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 1 gp  | 30 lb. | -                                |
| 10  | Gaster         | A series of bladders in the hindquarters of an ankheg, this organ is analagous to the Gaster intestines of a humanoid. Although ankhegs are known for eating flesh, they absorb the majority of their nutrients from the soil they burrow through. Artificers are able to take this fact and create a handy survival tool for explorers with a strong stomach.                                                                                                                               | 2 gp  | 9 lb.  | Canteen of Last Resort           |
| 13  | Ichor          | A creature that comes in contact with this mucus must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be Poisoned for 1 minute. The Poisoned creature is Paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 3 gp  | 1 lb.  | Oil of Sharpness, Midnight Tears |
| 15  | Bile (2 vials) | Ankhegs are well known for their incredibly potent digestive fluids that dissolve their prey. As such, alchemists find ankheg bile to be a particularly useful ingredient when creating their own acidic concoctions.<br><br>Use: As an action you may make a ranged weapon attack to throw this vial at a target within 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against the target, treating the vial as an improvised object. On a hit, the target suffers 1d6 acid damage. | 4 gp  | 1 lb.  | -                                |
