# Aboleth

| DC  | Item              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Value    | Weight | Crafting                  |

| 10  | Teeth (large bag) | The razor sharp teeth that line the stinking maw of the aboleth are each as large as a human's forearm and twice as thick. While too unwieldy and crooked to turn into a weapon, more exotic merchants would pay a tidy sum to turn them into decorations and trinkets.                                                 | 20 gp    | 15 lb. | -                         |
| 15  | Mucus (3 vials)   | Aboleths demand service and obsequience, even going so far as to warp the creatures around themselves to suit their domain. While the transformative mucus (3 vials) that surrounds the aboleth tends to dissipate quickly after their death, swift harvesters can bottle some of it for use in alchemy projects later. | 20 gp    | 1 lb.  | Potion of Water Breathing |
| 20  | Eye               | Larger than a normal creature's head. Removed from its skull and ever unblinking, it still seems to see more than most mortals ever will.                                                                                                                                                                               | 375 gp   | 45 lb. | Lens of Forgotten History |
| 25  | Brain Lobe        | The power of the aboleth lies not in its many tentacles, but in its brain. Even now and then, when you hold it long enough, you swear you can hear whispers of forgotten history in the corner of your mind.                                                                                                            | 1,600 gp | 30 lb. | Aboleth Amulet            |
