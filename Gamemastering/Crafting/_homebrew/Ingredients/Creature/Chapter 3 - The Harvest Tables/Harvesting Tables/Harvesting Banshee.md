| 15  | Echo    | The incorporeal banshee leaves very little behind except the last whispers of its terrible wail. With some spirit paper, a good harvester can collect the echo of this wail before it vanishes forever and use it in times of desperation. Requires spirit paper.<br><br>Use: You may spend an action to tear this item open and release the banshee wail kept within. All creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature drops to 0 hit points. On a success, a creature takes 3d6 psychic damage. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead. | 13 gp | 1 lb.  | -                       |
| 20  | Remnant | It takes a particularly nimble mind and fast action to trap enough remnants of a banshee to make a usable crafting item If successful however they are often refashioned into enchanted reeds that create a haunting noise when used in wind instruments. Requires spirit paper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 60 gp | 1 lb.  | Pipes of Haunting (DMG) |
