| 10  | Rune | Animating The basis of any animated object is the magical rune etched into its surface that enchants it and brings it to life. While these runes cannot be transferred from one object to another, resourceful tinkerers are capable of salvaging some of the expensive powders and ashes used to make them, and thus they can be sold for a small bit of profit. | 5 sp  | 1 lb.  | -        |

| 15  | Shimmer Cloth | The fibers of an enchanted rug continue to carry on a special property to them even after being rendered inanimate. When looked upon, these fibers seem to glimmer and move ever so slightly without any outside force acting on them. This property has been noted by tailors that incorporate them into various vanity items like the amusing cloak of mending or cloak of billowing. | 10 gp | 7 lb.  | Cloak of Mending (XGE) or Cloak of Billowing (XGE) |
