| DC  | Item                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Value | Weight | Crafting          |

| 10  | Cockatrice Bile (vial)             | Unlike basilisks, a cockatrice cannot consume stone. Unfortunately, anything that receives so much as a graze from its beak becomes petrified, and with the cockatrice's frenzied hunting style, such an occurrence is more then common. As such, its bile has certain properties that slow down the petrification process, allowing the cockatrice to get some nourishment before it's food becomes undigestable. The bile has become a staple in a stonemason's toolkit as allows them to temporarily soften stone for easier handling. | 2 sp  | 1 lb.  |                   |
| 15  | Cockatrice Droppings (small pouch) | Cockatrices are infamous for their enthusiasm in devouring a meal, and as such, they occasionally end up swallowing food that they have already accidentally petrified. The food remains stone through the cockatrice's digestive system, and some consider the resulting food statues to be a novelty to say the least. There are even some enterprising individuals who keep cockatrice farms in order to harvest their droppings for stone trinkets (I assume they do not reveal to their customers where they came from however).     | 5 sp  | 1 lb.  |                   |
| 20  | Beak                               | Cockatrice The infamous beak of a cockatrice, capable of turning any living creature into stone. Despite common belief, the petrifying magic has nothing to do with the cockatrice's saliva, but is entirely within the cockatrice's beak alone. Any artificer worth their salt knows the techniques to turn an undamaged beak into a weapon that shares the cockatrice's petrifying ability.                                                                                                                                             | 1 gp  | 1 1b.  | Petrifying Dagger |

# Couatl

| DC  | Item                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Value  | Weight | Crafting                     |

| 15  | Couatl Venom (vial)         | The venom of a couatl is entirely non-lethal, reflective of the couatl's pacifist nature. Couatl are in fact known for occasionally secreting this venom for the mortals they partner with in the hopes of averting deaths wherever possible.<br><br>**Use:** Can be used to coat up to 10 pieces of slashing and piercing ammunition or one slashing or piercing melee weapon. Applying the poison takes one minute. For the next 10 minutes any creature successfully hit must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, or become poisoned for 24 hours. Until this poison ends, the target is unconscious. A creature automatically wakes up if they receive damage or if an adjacent creature spends their action to wake them up. | 40 gp  | 1 lb.  |                              |
| 20  | Couatl Feathers (large bag) | The feathers of a couatl are extraordinarily vibrant, yet as soft as down. A particular Feather pillow has been made with these feathers that shares the couatl's ability to shield its mind from external psychic threats. Powerful people have been known to use these pillows to shield their sleeping moments from intrusion, as well as to just get an extremely comfortable sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 120 gp | 5 lb.  | Pillow of<br>Perfect<br>Rest |

| 10  | Cursed Knucklebones | The bones of a hand that has been transformed by necromantic manipulation are notable for still carrying trace elements of those same energies. They are not useful for much, but it is said that a set of dice carved from these knucklebones roll lower than is statistically likely, giving rise to the ubiquitous unlucky gambler term: "the dead man's hand." | 1 sp  | 2 lb.  | Charlatan's Die (XGE) |


# Cyclops

| 10  | Cyclops Eyelid | The enormous lid of a cyclops is made of a strange material, quite different to the rest of the cyclops' skin. The purpose of this is still a mystery, but various crafters have managed to take its esoteric properties and use it for their own entertaining projects.                                                                                                                                                       | 10 gp  | 4 lb.  | Deceptive Eyepatch |
| 15  | Cyclops Heart  | The extremely large heart of a cyclops. Makes a good trophy when preserved and mounted on a base.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 25 gp  | 25 lb. |                    |
| 20  | Cyclops Eye    | Once they are roused to interest, cyclopses are known to relentlessly pursue whatever it is they set their eye on. Experiments on cyclops remains have revealed that the eye itself is partly to blame, as its unique situation forces the cyclops to focus on one thing for prolonged periods of time. Artificers have taken this property and applied it into a battle aid that doubles as a stylish dinner party accessory. | 140 gp | 20 lb. | Monocle of Focus   |
