# Chapter 3: The Harvest Tables

> *After countless autopsies, vivisections, experiments, and just plain butchering, I have amassed what is most likely the most complete set of knowledge regarding the anatomies, uses, and values of the wondrous creatures that inhabit our worlds. I now present this knowledge (as well as some rather choice anecdotes) to you, dear reader.*

## Understanding the Tables

Every unique monster from the Monster Manual has been listed in this book with an associated harvest table. When your players attempt a harvest, simply look up the relevant monster in this guide and read out the results (monsters are listed in the same order as in the Monster Manual). The following is an explanation of how to read the table.

### DC
This is the DC required to harvest this item. Any [[Harvesting]] check that equals or exceeds this threshold allows the player that made that check to successfully harvest that item.

### Item
The name of the item received. While for most items, the player only receives one of the listed item, some item names have parentheses next to them. These indicate the amount that a player receives upon a successful harvest e.g.: Aarakocra Feather (small [[Pouch]]) or [[Harvesting Aboleth|Aboleth]] Mucus (3 vials). At the DM's discretion however, they may adjudicate that a player receives less or more than the stipulated quantity. Such reasons may include extremely high success on a roll, or certain methods in which the creature was killed.

### Optional Rule: Harvesting Dangerous Materials
[[Harvesting]] some creatures are more dangerous than others. While most creatures are harmless once killed, others possess [[poisons]], acids, and breath sacks that remain active even after the creature's death. Even worse is that a simple misplaced knife stroke or errant twitch of the hand can lead to these materials accidentally harming the harvester.

Under this optional rule, whenever a harvester rolls below the DC of a harvestable material that has a "Use" section that deals damage, the material is not just lost, it also expends its ability on the harvester. For example, a character that fails to properly harvest a poison would suffer the effect of that poison on themselves, or a character that fails to harvest a breath sack would release the effect of that breath sack in their direction. The exact adjudication of the failure result may change depending on the DM.

### Description

A brief description of the item to be harvested, written by Hamund. While this is usually just for flavour, some items also have a "Use" section. These items may be used immediately after being harvested and require no further adjustments or crafting. Their function is described here in the description box.

Additionally, some materials have harvesting requirements beyond just steady hands and a sharp knife. Any extra requirements or criteria for [[Harvesting]] a material will be listed here.

### Value

All materials are listed with their base resell value. This is how much money an average shopkeeper would be willing to pay for the materials in good conditions. DM discretion is advised when varying this value, dependant on shopkeeper mood, rarity within the setting, condition of the material, etc. A material with a value listed as "varies" indicates that its usage is too specific for it to be sold to an average shopkeeper, and the value of the material would depend heavily on context.

When items are harvested in discrete quantities, the value listed refers to each individual item. For example, [[Harvesting Aboleth|Aboleth]] Mucus is harvested as a set of 3 vials, and so the value listed (20 gp) refers to each individual vial (so successfully [[Harvesting]] [[Harvesting Aboleth|Aboleth]] Mucus would be worth 3 x 20 gp = 60 gp). When items are listed as indiscrete. quantities however, the value listed refers to the entire quantity. For example, Aarakocra Feathers are harvested in the indiscrete quantity of a: "small [[Pouch]]." Thus the 8 sp value listed refers to the value of a "small [[Pouch]] of Aarakocra Feathers," not 8 sp for each individual feather.

### Value Factors
The values listed here are based on a myriad of factors including: CR of the monster, average [[Treasure]] horde values, use in crafting, whether the monster tends to be found alone, whether the item is consumable, probability of successfully [[Harvesting]] the item, balance around existing prices, and sometimes just for flavour. These prices are intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For example, although a Death Knight Heart may be worth the high price of 4,000 gp, it may be difficult to sell it to the village grocer. Sometimes, finding the right buyer for an esoteric item can be an entertaining side quest in and of itself, or simply used as a good downtime activity.

### Weight
The weight of the item listed in pounds. The weight listed here follows the same rules as values do; the listed number refers to the weight of individual items, unless that item is harvested in indistinct quantities, in which case the weight refers to the whole indistinct quantity.

### Crafting
Some items, although valuable, require a skilled artisan to craft them into a usable item. The material's description details which item they can be crafted into. If this section is blank, the item has no craftable item associated with it.

The section of crafted items at the end of this book details the usage of crafted items, as well as details on their crafting requirements. Some craftable items originate from published source books from WotC. These receive special tags in brackets that denote which book they come from.

## Humanoid Trinket Tables

> *"In general, humanoids do not yield much in the way of harvestable materials. Partly this is just the negative relationship that humanoid evolution has with innate magical abilities, but mostly it's just because polite society frowns upon butchering things that look vaguely like themselves."*

-Hamund

Most humanoids listed in this book do not possess many useful materials to harvest. In order to complement the relatively bare tables of humanoids, a separate table is listed in their section describing items that may be plundered off of these creatures. These items tend to be random trinkets and are not weapons or armour. More often than not, they are relatively useless and are intended only to be used for resale.

There is no ability check required to pilfer these trinkets, and the DM is free to decide which of these trinkets can be found on a typical corpse (if any at all). These tables are intended to be largely used as DM inspiration and to sate the lust of loot-hungry players while avoiding the ghoulish activity of dismembering a humanoid corpse.

Like all harvested items, the value and weight listed refers to 1 unit of the respective item in that row.
