# Chapter 2: How to Harvest

The act of removing useful body parts from a creature is referred to as [[Harvesting]].

Anything that can be harvested from a creature is referred to as a [[Harvesting]] material or simply material. In general, only creatures that have died may be harvested, but there may be some exceptions based on context.

This section details the steps associated with actually performing a harvest, and any factors that may influence it.

### Particularly Violent Deaths

> *"I know that it is a dangerous world out there, and we all must do what we can to survive. But do understand that there are few people out there that are in the market for a charred [[Owlbear]] pelt with more holes in it than the plot of a bad novel."*

-Hamund

This guide assumes that most creatures you attempt to harvest died in direct [[combat]] and thus already accounts for the idea that you are [[Harvesting]] creatures that are not in pristine condition. However, some deaths are more violent than others and can make [[Harvesting]] useful materials either extremely difficult or downright impossible. Such examples include burning by fire, dissolving from [[acid]], or being completely crushed under a pillar of stone. In these cases, raise the DC for [[Harvesting]] any of that creature's materials by 5. Alternatively, the DM may decide that well-orchestrated hunts result in a carcass that is prime for [[Harvesting]], such as creatures killed mostly through psychic damage, or those killed in one clean attack. In these cases, the DM should lower the DC for [[Harvesting]] any of that creature's materials by 5.

Furthermore, the DM may adjudicate whether or not some of a creature's individual materials have been made useless due to effects imposed by them in the course of their death. Examples may include blood being tainted from poisoning, or their pelt being worthless due to excessive slashing/piercing damage.

### Optional Rule: Carcass Degredation
This guide mostly assumes that [[Harvesting]] takes place on a freshly killed corpse and that little to no decomposition has yet occurred. However, in some cases, a player may desire to harvest a creature that has been dead for quite a while. In these cases, the DM may declare that certain body parts have already withered away and become unharvestable or may decide to increase the DC's of all harvestable materials as if the creature had died a particularly violent death. If corpse decomposition is too advanced, it is entirely within the DM's right to deny [[Harvesting]] the creature altogether.

As a quick guide, the following timeline may be observed to decide on decomposition levels:

- ﻿﻿**1 hour after death:** The carcass' hide has ruptured from bloating and has become useless.
- ﻿﻿**1 day after death:** The carcass' blood has become too tainted to be useful, and soft tissues like the eyes have putrefied.
- ﻿﻿**3 days after death:** The carcass' internal organs have decomposed
- ﻿﻿**7 days after death:** The carcass has undergone extensive purification and none of its soft tissue remains harvestable.
- ﻿﻿**Note:** Harder materials like bones, teeth, claws, and hair do not generally undergo decomposition and will remain usable indefinitely.
