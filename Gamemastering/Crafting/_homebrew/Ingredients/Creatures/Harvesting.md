## Harvesting

In order to harvest a creature, a character must make a [[Dexterity]] ability check using the same skill proficiency as listed in the above [[Appraising]] table. For example, a character attempting a harvest check on an Aberrant would receive a bonus equal to their [[Dexterity]] modifier and their proficiency in [[Arcana]] (if they have any).

This check reflects a character's ability to not only properly remove the intended item without damaging it, it also involves any ancillary requirements of the harvest such as proper preservation and storage techniques.

Each individual item in a creature's harvesting table is listed with a DC next to it. Any roll that a player makes that equals or exceeds this DC grants that player that item.

Rewards are cumulative, and a player receives every item with a DC equal to or below their ability check result. For example, rolling a total of 15 on a check to harvest an [[5eOSRD/Bestiary/Azer]] will reward the player with both "[[5eOSRD/Bestiary/Azer]] ash', and "[[5eOSRD/Bestiary/Azer]] bronze skin", but not a "spark of creation". If they so wish, players may opt to not harvest a material even if they have met the DC threshold to harvest it.

Only one harvesting attempt may be made on a creature.

Failure to meet a certain item's DC threshold assumes that the item was made unsalvageable due to the harvester's incompetence.

For most creatures, the time it takes to harvest a material is counted in minutes and is equal to the DC of that material divided by 5. For huge creatures however, it is equal in DC of that material, while for gargantuan creatures, it is equal to the DC of that material multiplied by 2.

### Using Other Proficiencies
If a player is harvesting a certain creature, or harvesting a creature of a certain type of material, the DM may allow them to use a relevant tool proficiency rather than a skill proficiency.

For example, the DM may allow a player to add their proficiency with Tinker's Tools to their attempt to harvest a mechanical golem or use their proficiency with leatherworking tools when attempting to harvest a creature for its hide. Alternatively, all creature type proficiencies may be replaced by proficiency with the harvesting kit.
