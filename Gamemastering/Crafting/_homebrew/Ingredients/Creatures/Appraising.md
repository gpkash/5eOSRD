## Appraising

> *"My mother always used to press the importance of taking one's time and not jumping into things. This advice holds true whether one is harvesting a creature, engaging in a fight, or literally jumping into a river."*

-Hamund

Before a player begins hacking and butchering their hunt, they may instead choose to take a moment first and ***appraise*** the creature to be harvested. To do this, they must spend 1 minute examining the creature to be harvested and then roll an [[Intelligence]] check, adding their [[proficiency bonus]] if they are proficient in the skill corresponding to that creature (see table below). For example, appraising a Beholder (which is an aberrant), the check would be an [[Intelligence]] ([[Arcana]]) check, while appraising an [[Ogre]] (which is a giant) would require an [[Intelligence]] ([[Medicine]]) check.

The DC of the check is equal to **8 + the Harvested Creature's CR** (treating any CR less than 1 as 0). Success on this check grants the player full knowledge of any useful harvesting materials on the creature, the DC requirement to harvest those materials, any special requirements to harvest them, and any potential risks in doing so. In addition, any [[Harvesting]] check made on that creature by that player is rolled at advantage. A character may only attempt one appraisal check per creature.

### Splitting up the Responsibilities

Some party members may prefer to let one character handle the appraisal of materials, while another more dextrous character handles the actual [[Harvesting]]. In this scenario, all benefits of appraising a creature are conferred to the player doing the [[Harvesting]], so long as the player that performed the appraising assists the [[Harvesting]] player through the whole duration of the harvest.
