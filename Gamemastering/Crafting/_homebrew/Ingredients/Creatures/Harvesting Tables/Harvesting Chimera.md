| 10  | Chimera<br><br>Goat Hoof (×2)          | The hindquarters of the monstrous chimera. While they resemble an ordinary goat in shape, they are noticebly larger in size. While not usable for much, they do make for fine trophies.                                                                                                                             | 2 gp   | 6 lb.  | -                   | 
| 15  | Chimera Goat Head                      | Chimera One of the chimera's three heads. Larger than a regular goat's, the horns are<br><br>particularly hard and large. Many mountain folk consider an ale mug made from a chimera's horns to be a very enticing gift.                                                                                            | 25 gp  | 20 lb. | Chimera Trident     |
| 15  | Chimera<br><br>Lion Paw (×2)           | The leonine front paws of the chimera. Larger than a normal lion's, with claws twice as sharp. Some druids prefer using these as their focus when performing transmutation magic, believing that it makes their spellwork easier. Whether that is true or not has yet to be confirmed.                              | 4 gp   | 6 lb.  | -                   |
| 20  | Chimera Lion Head                      | One of the chimera's three heads. Larger than a regular lion's, this head makes a<br><br>antastic trophy when stuffed and mounted, particularly when placed in the quarters of a skittish house guest.                                                                                                              | 40 gp  | 25 lb. | Chimera Trident     |
| 20  | Chimera<br><br>Dragon<br><br>Wing (×2) | The draconic wings of the chimera. While they lack the same amount of magical power as a genuine dragon's wings, they are also much easier to handle and much easier to get a hold of. Daring tinkers have taken to using them in making kites strong enough to lift smaller races high into the air.               | 25 gp  | 30 lb. | Chimera<br><br>Kite |
| 25  | Chimera Dragon<br><br>Head             | One of the chimera's three heads. While the flame is less powerful than a genuine<br><br>dragon's, the glands that produce the flame is much easier to access in a chimera's head, and provide materials that are much more stable to work with. Alchemists prize these glands as a source of highly flammable oil. | 150 gp | 25 lb. | Chimera Trident     |
