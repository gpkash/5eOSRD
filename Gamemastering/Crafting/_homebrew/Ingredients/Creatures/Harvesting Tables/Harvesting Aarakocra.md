# Aarakocra

> *"Aarakocra are an interesting folk. As stoic and flighty as the birds they resemble, they nevertheless make good company when coaxed down from their solitary perches. Interesting as well is that despite being very magical themselves, their wings are relatively useless for any sort of crafting. Perhaps the Wind Dukes of Aaga realised that having servants everyone would want to hunt would be a bad idea."*

| 5   | Feathers (small pouch) | The large feathers of an aarakocra are enjoyed among some of the more ostentatious members of society as fun accessories and fashion highlights. If you can find a tailor willing to take them, you are sure to be able to earn at least a few silver for a good amount of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 8 sp  | 2 lb.  | -        |
| 10  | Heart                  | Aarakocra have an innate connection to the elemental planes that allows them to summon air elementals when enough of them gather together. Burning their hearts in an offering can achieve much of the same effect but with less control over the temperament of the summoned elemental. **Use:** When 5 different creatures within 30 feet of each other hold 5 different aarakocra hearts and spend their actions on three consecutive turns to burn the hearts, they may summon an air elemental in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. The burners must remain still while burning the hearts. This elemental is hostile to all creatures it can see around it, but any of the 5 creatures that summoned it can spend their action to try and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to direct the air elemental's hostility at a creature they can both see within 60 feet. The air elemental remains for 1 hour. | 2 gp  | 5 lb.  | -        |
