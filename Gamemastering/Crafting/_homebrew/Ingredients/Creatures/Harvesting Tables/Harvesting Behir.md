| 10  | Scales (Large bag) | The scales of a behir resemble a dragon's but are different in many ways in the eyes of a trained observer. While these scales are often found decorating items in an unscrupulous tailor's shop marketed as actual dragon scales, the fact that they are much smoother and more flexible than an actual dragon's makes them much more useful for fashion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 55 gp  | 25 lb. | -                             |
| 15  | Horn               | The horn of a behir is composed of a unique keratin that has an odd reaction to the presence of dragons. A dragon's mere presence causes these horns to resonate, usually alerting a behir to the presence of their hated foe. The horns will still function in the hands of anyone else, but the dragon usually must be much closer for the vibrations to be detected.<br><br>Use: When within 1 mile of a dragon (whether it in its true form or polymorphed into a different shape), this horn will begin to vibrate, with the vibrations becoming more pronounced the closer it is to the dragon. This horn does not indicate the direction of the dragon, only its general proximity.             | 300 gp | 30 lb. | -                             |
| 20  | Lightning Sack     | This large, but surprisingly light leathery sack is located at the back of the behir's cavernous mouth, and is roughly the size of a picnic basket. Inside is a mixture of chemicals, fluids and enzymes that when exposed to the open air, erupts in a destructive crackle of lightning. While extremely dangerous, alchemists and weaponsmiths alike will crawl over themselves to obtain some of this powerful energy.<br><br>Use: The lightning sack can be thrown by itself up to a range of 20 feet. If thrown, the lightning sack will explode on impact, dealing 4d10 lightning damage to all creatures in a 10 foot radius, or half that on a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. | 875 gp | 10 lb. | Lightning Oil or Storm Caller |
