| 10  | Ash               | Residual material from the azer's corpse. This ash still maintains a faint trace of the magic that created it. While not overly useful, some artisans like to sprinkle it over their creations for good luck.                                                                                                                                                                            | 1 sp  | 1 lb.  | -                |
| 15  | Bronze Skin       | Azers need no armour, as their skin is already made of durable, mastercrafted bronze. While the trauma of its owner's demise has made the skin difficult to repurpose directly for armour, it is still high quality material, and any blacksmith worth their salt would be happy to get it.                                                                                              | 10 gp | 50 lb. | -                |
| 20  | Spark of Creation | Although the azer of this particular flame of creation is dead, a single smouldering spark remains, and those with knowledge of the arcane are able to quickly harvest and store it safely for later use. While small, these sparks have Immense potential and are often used in either the construction of living trinkets, or the lighting of magical forges. Requires enchanted vial. | 12 gp | 1 lb.  | Bronze Companion |
