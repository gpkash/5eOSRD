## Beholder
| DC  | Item      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Value    | Weight | Crafting           |

| 15  | Membrum   | The anatomy of a beholder is infinitely alien and strange to any scholar native to the Material Plane. One of the most curious features of the beholder is that aside from its brain, the beholder features a noticeable dearth of internal organs.<br><br>Instead, any internal space not occupied by brain matter is filled with a large rubbery balloon that seems to act as the beholder's heart, lungs, and stomach.<br><br>How it achieves all of these simultaneous functions is unknown. This organ is as versatile as its owner, and many scholars are eager to obtain a complete sample for their research into transmutation. | 45 gp    | 40 lb. | Crafting           |
| 20  | Eye Stalk | While the eye stalks of the beholder may be severed from its body, they still retain some of the magical energy that allowed them to fire powerful rays at their enemies. Skilled artificers can take these stalks and use them as the cores of magical wands that emit the same types of rays they emitted in life. Alternatively, four of the intact stalks may be used as part of a ritual to summon a spectator.<br><br>If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll 1d10. The type of eye stalk they receive corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the beholder statblock.                                                   | 650 gp   | 9 lb.  | Eye Stalk Wand     |
| 25  | Main Eye  | The main eye of the beholder is unique in that instead of issuing forth a beam of magical energy, it instead does the opposite: emitting a cone of nullification that disrupts the Weave and prevents the functioning of any magic it gazes at. While it is inactive due to being severed from a living beholder, learned wizards know how to transfigure this organ into an anti-magic crystal, the type that can be used to protect their own strongholds against magical incursions.                                                                                                                                                  | 3,250 gp | 30 lb. | Anti-Magic Crystal |


## Death Tyrant
| DC  | Item | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Value    | Weight | Crafting                |

| 15  | Jaw  | The teeth of a beholder must never be underestimated, even in death. Their jaws possess a wicked bite, and when attached to the handle of an axe, so can your backswing.                                                                                                                                    | 700 gp   | 20 lb. | Greataxe +2 (DMG)       |
| 25  | Eye  | The eye of a beholder undergoes a terrible transformation when it transitions into undeath, emitting a cone of negative energy rather than anti-magic. But like a normal beholder eye, this eye can be transformed into a crystal of great power that many powerful wizards enjoy employing in their lairs. | 3,500 gp | 20 lb. | Negative Energy Crystal |

## Spectator
| DC  | Item      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Value | Weight | Crafting              |

| 15  | Eye Stalk | The stalks of the spectator are less powerful than those of the beholder it consumed to be summoned. However, their potential to be made into wands by artificers are the same. When crafted properly, they continue to contain an arcane charge that allows them to discharge the same types of magical rays they did in life.<br><br>If a player harvests an eye stalk, roll 1d4. The type of eye stalk they receive corresponds to the number rolled, as described in the spectator statblock. | 14 gp | 7 lb.  | Lesser Eye Stalk Wand |
| 20  | Main Eye  | Spectator The main eye of the spectator functions differently to that of the beholder. While the beholder's emits an anti-magic cone at all times, the spectator's can be used to reflect poorly casted spells at other targets. When used for crafting, the magic of the eye can be transferred over to a shield, to grant it the same ability.                                                                                                                                                  | 60 gp | 20 lb. | Shield of Reflection  |
