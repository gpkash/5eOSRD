#### Death Cap
Though unassuming looking with a slender, white stalk and white to lightly brown, death cap is dangerous. 12 hours after ingesting the mushroom or an extract of it, a creature must make a DC 17 constitution saving throw or be poisoned. Once a creature is poisoned, it takes 2d8 poison damage and suffers severe stomach aches and cramps lasting 24 hours. If antidote is not taken during this period, the creatureâ€™s liver starts being degraded resulting in jaundice and takes 1d10 poison damage at midday until a Greater Restoration or Regenerate is performed or an elixir of health is consumed.
