#### The Bearded Green
A beautiful mushroom with an emerald green cap, stark white stalk, black gills and a network of white and grey strands hanging from the edge of the cap resembling a beard. The mushroom is a bit of a contradiction. Eating it without first soaking it in an alkaline solution for a day is delicious, but it can seriously damage the kidneys and forces the eater to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 5 poison damage. However, it also has great curative alongside its toxic capabilities.
