#### Bloodroot
On first glance, these roots look a lot like purple carrots, but upon being cut or broke ooze a bloodred liquid. If processed properly, this can be used as a long lasting dye or even food colouring. However, improper preparation can instead result in skin irritation or food poisoning.
