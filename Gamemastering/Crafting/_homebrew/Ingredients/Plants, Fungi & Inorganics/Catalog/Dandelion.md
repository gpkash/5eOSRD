#### Dandelion

Through early spring and deep into late summer sprout dandelions with their bright yellow heads or their puff-ball appearance. A gardenerâ€™s bane, witches and herbalists alike have divined their true value. While dandelions are extremely prevalent, they are nearly impossible to use in aiding divination magic, which is their truest value.
