#### Blight Spores

Bright red spores from Blightshrooms, growing exclusively in caves on the Blightshore and the Eastern side of the Penumbra Range. A creature exposed to a large dose of the spores must succeed a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be Poisoned for 3d6 hours. While the creature is poisoned, it experiences the same effects as if it were under the Confusion spell. A restoration spell or a dose of antitoxin can remove the effect.
