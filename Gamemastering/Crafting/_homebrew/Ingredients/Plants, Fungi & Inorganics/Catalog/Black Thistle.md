#### Black Thistle
These flowers are very rare and only found in one of two locations: in the gardens of very specialized herbalists or on farmland previously raided by wyverns. This is due to how wyvernâ€™s poison can chemically burn plants and the soil beneath them if applied in moderate to high doses (4 ounces/1 vial per 25 square feet or higher), though finding this concentration outside of specialized gardens is rare. If this burned soil is then sown with barley seed with at most 30 seeds per square foot, a jet black plant with glass-like, white needles covering its stem and metallic cobalt flowers sprouts from each seed, taking 3 months to grow to maturity. 
This plant is extraordinarily dangerous, every part of it being loaded with toxins. Touching the needles without dragon leather gloves causes 1 piercing damage and 1d12 poison damage. When the stem is first cut, it sprays its sap for a 2 ft cone. If any of this sap comes in contact with uncovered skin, it causes 2d10 poison damage. This same sap is also present in the roots, though does not spray out when cut. Even its flowers contain poison in its nectar, killing any insect that feeds on it instantly, though contact with it is very hard for anything bigger than an ant. These plants can last for up to 5 years, though do not produce seeds.
