#### Dreamlily
A white, slightly silvery 5 pointed flower with an intoxicating smell. It can be soaked in warm water to create a psychoactive liquid that smells and tastes like your favorite beverage. 
A creature under the effects of dreamlily is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead.
