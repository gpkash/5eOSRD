# Deathbane Berries

Deathbane is a small, herbaceous bush that grows tiny black berries. The berries are tart and bitter, and each contains a single large seed. These bushes grow in warm climates and form large thickets between the trunks of trees, and at the height of summer they are covered in berries.

## Effect
When a creature consumes a handful of deathbane berries, they gain advantage on all death saving throws for 24 hours. However, they automatically fail their first death saving throw when they fall unconscious.
