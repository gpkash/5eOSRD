#### Rainbow Mushroom 
This shroom appears like a very ordinary one, brown cap, black gills and white stem. That is, until one is cut. The hood’s exposed flesh is first a rosemary green, then turns a light blue before turning a deep shade of Bordeaux. The stem’s colour instead goes from a deep blue to a pale orange after being cut or torn. Eating this mushroom forces the consumer to make a DC 14 wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the consumer becomes confused for 30 minutes. During this period, the consumer sees colours change from one shade to another as well as several times more intense than normal.
