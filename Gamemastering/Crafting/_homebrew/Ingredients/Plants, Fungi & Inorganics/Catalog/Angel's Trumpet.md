#### Angel’s Trumpet
Its name is based on the shape and beauty of the flower: the purest of white and trumpet shaped with yellow stems. However, it is a dangerous plant. Inhaling the scent directly from the flower forces a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. A failed save leaves the target confused for 1 minute. During this period, the target cannot move, take actions or reactions. This characteristic has been used in poisons to paralyze targets or make slaves more docile.
