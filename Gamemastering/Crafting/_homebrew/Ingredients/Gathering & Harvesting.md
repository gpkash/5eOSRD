## Gathering & Harvesting

### Rules for Gathering
Certain areas may contain several harvestable plants, fungi or, rarely, animals. To determine what goods can be found in areas, make a nature check. If the check is:
- ≥DC10 all common plants and fungi bound to that environment are identified
- ≥DC15 all common and uncommon plants and fungi bound to that environment are identified
- ≥DC20 all common, uncommon and rare plants and fungi bound to that environment are identified

The DM can decide to be more or less lenient depending on the area, a lush jungle may contain more interesting herbs and fungi than a windswept desert, after all. A DM can also pick and choose a few ingredients.

Inspecting an area to make the nature check takes 15 minutes. If the DM allows it, a +3 can be added to the check for each additional 15 minutes spent on investigating the area to a maximum of +6.

The player can repeatedly search an area without repercussions on the amount of ingredients obtained from an area.

### Rules for Harvesting
Once a herb or fungus is identified and the player is proficient with the herbalism kit, they can throw a d20 and add their proficiency bonus and their Potion Making Level modifier (see page 22) to that throw to determine if they can harvest the ingredient. 

Harvesting an ingredient takes 10 minutes. If the DM allows it, a +3 can be added to the check for each additional 10 minutes spent on gathering the ingredient to a maximum of +6. The player must decide beforehand how long they want to spent on harvesting the ingredient.

If the player fails to harvest an ingredient, a d4 is thrown. On a:
- 1: the ingredient is destroyed
- 2: the quantity of the ingredient is reduced by half
- 3: the quantity of the ingredient is reduced by a quarter
- 4: the ingredient is unaffected

Obtaining animal based ingredients doesn’t require proficiency with the associated kit, but must have access to the kit, though doing so provides the player with a -3 modifier instead of the proficiency modifier when the player is proficient with the kit. A player is always proficient with a knife. Harvesting an ingredient takes 10-30 minutes (DM's choice). If the DM allows it, a +3 can be added to the check for each additional 15 minutes spent on harvesting the ingredient to a maximum of +6.

Attempting to harvest animal ingredients can be done only once, failure results in the destruction of all harvestable ingredients.

### Important!
Each item gathered is a separate, 10+/30+ min action. A player collecting more than 1 ingredient must spent an additional 10+/30+ min gathering it, but does not have to roll a new nature check.

### Potion Crafting
When the player has gathered all required potion ingredients, tools and recipes and decides to make a certain potion or other product with one of their kits, the player must spend the required amount of gold (with the cost of the ingredients subtracted), as well as the number of workdays working on their project. The workdays don’t have to be subsequent and can be broken down further into single hours of work, with each workday is lasting 8 hours. If the DM allows it, the player may spent more than 8 hours a day working on their project. The player is allowed to spent their long rest working on their project if they are under the influence of items like Midnight oil or features like the warlock's Aspect of the moon. Progress done this way is at half the normal rate.

After the player has spent the required time working on the potion, they roll a d20, add their proficiency and their Potion Making Level modifier (See next page) to the total. If the player makes the check, the product is successfully completed. If the player fails the check, they are allowed to recover the ingredients, though lose the gold invested.

### Pricing Guide
Potions, poisons and other products have set prices based on their rarity. This cost is paid up front once the production is started. The price of ingredients used is subtracted from this price. The price of the product depends on its rarity and can be found in the table below. 

If a potion making Check is failed, the original ingredients are returned, though gold spent is lost.

| Ingredient Rarity | Cost   |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Common            | 5 gp   |
| Uncommon          | 10 gp  |
| Rare              | 50 gp  | 
| Very Rare         | 150 gp |
| Legendary         | 500 gp |
