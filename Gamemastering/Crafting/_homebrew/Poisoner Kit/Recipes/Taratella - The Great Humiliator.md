#### Taratella - The Great Humiliator
Drinking this murky, muddy brown liquid forces the consumer to make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes poisoned indefinitely. While poisoned, the consumer has vivid dreams and occasional hallucinations of people laughing at them takes 1d4+1 psychic poison every 6 hours. On a successful saving throw, the target is poisoned for 2 days, but only takes 2 psychic damage every 6 hours. The only known way to rid oneself of the poison is to dance as poorly as one can for 1 hour in a town square during daytime.
