#### Nausea Pellet*
A black pellet made from Sourgrass that can be thrown as an improvised weapon with a 20/40 range. When thrown at a target, it shatters into a fine powder filling a 5x5ft square. Creatures in that square must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 30 seconds and can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn. Affected creatures can also decide to spend their action throwing up or a bonus action taking a Stomach Stopper to rid themselves of the poisoned condition.

Holding oneâ€™s breath is ineffective as the powder targets the nasal mucosal membranes. Constructs are not affected. 

Type: Inhaled
Ingredients: Sourgrass (2)
