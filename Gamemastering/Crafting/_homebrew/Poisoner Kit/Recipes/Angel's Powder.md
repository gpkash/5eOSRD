#### Angel's Powder *
A hyper fine, bright white powder with a faintly sweet aroma, this powder is to be blown into the face of the target before dispersing harmlessly into the air. The target has to make a DC 15 Charisma Saving throw. On a failed save, the target experiences an altered version of reality where it perceives everyone as trusted friends and becomes extremely suggestible to non-aggressive forms of persuasion and deception as well as to seduction for 1 hour. On a successful save, the target experiences no effects.
