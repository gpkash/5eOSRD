#### Medusa’s Vengance
This thick, grey liquid is a poison is to be applied to weapons or ammunition. If those weapons come in contact with the blood of a creature 3 times, the target is forced to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become petrified over the next 3 turns; becoming more and more sluggish at the start of each of their turns, losing 1/3 of their max movement speed. On a failed save, the target loses 5ft of movement for the next 15 minutes. Once a target has made a successful saving throw, they are immune to the poison for the next minute. 

The poison can coat a weapon for 5 minutes or 20 pieces of ammunition for a period of 3 days. Constructs are not affected by this poison.
