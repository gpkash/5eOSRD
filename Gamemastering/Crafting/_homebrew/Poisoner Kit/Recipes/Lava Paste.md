#### Lava Paste
Though a mundane looking, yellowish paste, this concoction is anything but. Once applied on skin or clothing, the paste forces the target to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 fire damage and becomes vulnerable against fire damage for 1 occasion for the next 12 hours, on a successful save the target takes half damage and does not become vulnerable.
