#### Directed Delay
This black liquid is highly viscous, having the consistency of concentrated molasses. When brought in contact with the blood via an injury or injection, the target has to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target experiences the effect of the Slow spell and can remake the saving throw at the end of each turn. On a successful save, the targetâ€™s movement speed is reduced by 5 feet for 3 turns.
