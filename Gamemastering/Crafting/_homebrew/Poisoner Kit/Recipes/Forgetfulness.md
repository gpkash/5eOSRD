#### Forgetfulness
This fine, lavender coloured powder is the bane of wizards and natural philosophers. Breathing it in forces the target to make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes poisoned. While poisoned, the target has disadvantage on Intelligence saving throws and checks and needs to make a DC 7 intelligence check each time they try to remember something that happened at least 4 weeks ago. The target can repeat the saving throw at the start of every morning. On a successful save, the target experiences no effects.
