#### Devil's Powder
A hyper fine, red powder with a faintly smoky aroma, this powder is to be blown into the face of the target before dispersing harmlessly into the air. The target has to make a DC 18 Charisma Saving throw. On a failed save, the target experiences an altered version of reality where it perceives the world as a hellscape inhabited by foul creatures and becomes extremely vulnerable to intimidation, aggressive forms of persuasion and deception for 1 hour. On a successful save, the target becomes slightly paranoid and skittish.
