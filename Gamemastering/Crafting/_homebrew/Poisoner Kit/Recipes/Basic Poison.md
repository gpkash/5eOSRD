You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the Poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10, 12 or 14 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4, 2d4 or 3d4 poison damage, depending on the potency, and become poisoned until their next long rest. Once applied, the poison retains potency on the weapon for 1 minute before drying.
