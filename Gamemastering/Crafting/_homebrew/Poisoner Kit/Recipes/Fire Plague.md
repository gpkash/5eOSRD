#### Fire Plague
A rose-orange powder that is to be baked into bread or pastry. The baked goods take on a slight red hue. Eating at least a quarter of the bread or pastry forces the consumer to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the consumer takes 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 necrotic damage, becomes poisoned and gets necrotic patches of skin all over their body. While poisoned, the consumer has vivid hallucinations concerning death and demise. The saving throw can be remade every morning. On a successful save, all effects end.
