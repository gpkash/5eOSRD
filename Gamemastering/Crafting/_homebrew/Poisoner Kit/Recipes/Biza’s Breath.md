#### Biza’s Breath 

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 12, 15 or 18 Constitution saving throw, depending on it's potency, or become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no other creature within its reach, the poisoned creature does nothing on its turn. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
