#### Armourer’s Blight
This seemingly harmless, pale green liquid is what keeps the master armourer up at night. Designed and brewed carefully to turn the best armour in the realm into an unwearable death trap, this poison has the unique ability to seep into metal. When poured, smeared or thrown on a piece of armour, this oil forces the wearer of that armour to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the start of each turn or take 4d6 lightning damage. On a successful saving throw, the target instead takes 4 lightning damage. This poison lasts for 10 years and can only be removed by heating the metal to at least 700 °C/ 1300 °F.
