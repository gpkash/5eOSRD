#### Acid Tablets*
Designed to look like Stomach Stoppers, these tablet pack a punch. Consuming one forces the target to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage and be unable to vomit for 30 seconds. At the start of each subsequent turn, the target must repeat the saving throw. A successful saving throw allows the target to throw up and rid themselves of the poisonâ€™s effect.
