#### Sandman’s Revenge
This yellowish, chunky powder is a poison to be blown into the face of the target. Upon contact, the target must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. Upon a failure, the target take 2d10 necrotic damage and suffers 3 levels of exhaustion. Upon a success, the target takes 4 necrotic damage and suffers 1 level of exhaustion. 

Holding one’s breath is ineffective as the powder targets the nasal mucosal membranes. Constructs and the undead are not affected.
