#### Noxious Transpiration
This pale turquoise poison has a very unique way of working. Drinking it itself is not dangerous but causes the drinkerâ€™s sweat to turn poisonous for 1 hour. This effect only happens 2 hours after drinking it. Any contact with the drinker with a surface of skin approximately the size of the palm of the hand or larger forces the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 1d10+4 poison damage. A successful save results in no damage. Once the target is exposed once, it cannot be affected by the poison again for 12 hours.
