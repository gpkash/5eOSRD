#### Magic’s Bane
Magic can be one of the most powerful forces in existence and a great bane towards anyone trying to fight a powerful magical creature. This clear, colourless potion with a purple, cloudy sphere darting through it when brought in contact with the blood of a creature forces it to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, its ability to cast spells is disrupted for 1 minute, needing to make 10 arcana check to be able to use their spell. The saving throw can be repeated at the end of every turn. On a successful save, the target experiences no effects.

Type: Injury, Injection
Ingredients: Bane Berry, The Bearded Green, Wolf’s Bane
