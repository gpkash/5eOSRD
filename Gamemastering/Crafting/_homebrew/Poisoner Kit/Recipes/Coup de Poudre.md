#### Coup de Poudre
This is a most vile concoction that is needed in the larger process to turn a living humanoid into a loyal Revenant. To make it, a person needs proficiency with the Poisonerâ€™s and Alchemy kit. The powder is made from herbs, powdered human bones and certain animal poisons.

If ingested, the brew forces the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at midnight or take 5d8 necrotic and 5d8 poison damage on a failure or half that on a successful save. If the target drops to 0 hp or lower from this, it enters a state resembling death. The body then needs to be buried within 3 days and exhumed within 8 hours. If that is done, the next step can begin. 

The poisoner then needs to perform a 4 hour ritual where the soul of the deceased is captured in the jar and sealed and the body is bound to the poisoner. The body then reanimates and becomes a Revenant in loyal service to the poisoner. The only follows verbal orders spoken in a language the victim understood, which can be done as a bonus action.

Any damage to the Revenant is healed at midnight. As long as the jar remains intact and sealed and the Revenant never drops to 0 hp, the service remains indefinitely.
