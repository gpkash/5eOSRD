#### Potion of True Dreaming
Black as the void, this liquid appears to flash in bright colours when looked at through the corner of oneâ€™s eye. 
When you drink this potion before falling asleep, your dreams show you true visions of of the past, present or possible future events related to a creature, location or object of your choosing. The DM determines the nature and duration of these visions.

Ingredients: Nothic Tear, Willowshade Fruit or Willowshade Oil.
