#### Potion of Shapeshifting
A very peculiar potion that changes its colour, clarity as well as the shape and material of its container every time no one is looking at it. Upon opening the container, it reverts back to its original container and appearance; a faint pink potion with suspended slivers of silver. 
Drinking this potion allows the drinker to use the Alter Self spell on themselves for 30 minutes without concentration.

Ingredients: Rainbow Mushroom, Olisuba Leaf
