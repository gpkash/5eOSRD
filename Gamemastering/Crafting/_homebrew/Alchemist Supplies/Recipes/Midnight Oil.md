#### Midnight Oil
When the midnight oil is used to light a lantern, it emits bright light for 5 feet and dim light a further 5 feet for 8 hours. If a creature stays in the light emitted by this oil for the full 8 hours, they get all the benefits of a long rest without needing to sleep, provided they only engage in light activity such as reading, studying, talking, etc.

Ingredients: Flask of Oil, Pixie's Parasol
