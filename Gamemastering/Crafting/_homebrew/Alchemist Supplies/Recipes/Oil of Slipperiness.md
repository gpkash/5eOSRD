#### Oil of Slipperiness
This oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each large size category). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours. The oil can also be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.

Ingredients: Flask of Oil, Crawler Mucus, Water Elemental Droplet
