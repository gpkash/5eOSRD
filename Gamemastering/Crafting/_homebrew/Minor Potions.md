## Minor Potions

Minor potions are produced with either the alchemy or herbalism kit. They have reduced creation times and costs compared to more complicated potions and most recipes do not require special ingredients, instead being produced solely with basic ingredients. They are often produced in batches and can be highly sought after as commercial products with at least some of them found in any responsible apothecary store. 

Recipes for minor potions are considered common knowledge and can be easily found and learned within 15 minutes and do not require mastering. Each time the player's proficiency bonus increases, the player can learn 2 new recipes. Learning a new minor potion recipe or completing a single dose or batch does not yield any Potion Making Exp. Successfully creating a minor potion requires passing a DC 7. 

Individual minor potions cost 10 gold and 2 hours to produce, while a batch of 5 takes 45 gold and 8 hours. Potions that require special ingredients can be produced in single doses but this consumes the entire ingredient while not reducing the cost of the single dose. For example, a batch of 5 dandruff ointments requires 1 acid dew and 35 gp for a price of 7 Gp per dose. If the player decides to brew only 1 dose, this costs 1 acid dew and 7 gp. Minor potions have a market value of 20 gp unless specified otherwise.
