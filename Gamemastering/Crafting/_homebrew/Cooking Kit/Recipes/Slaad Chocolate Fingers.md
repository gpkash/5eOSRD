This type of meat can be cooked then covered in chocolate, although the process as well as the result is quite volatile.

- ﻿﻿Required Spices: 8 gp
- ﻿﻿Portions Created: 4
- ﻿﻿Weight / Portion: 1 pound
- ﻿﻿Cooking DC: 16
- ﻿﻿Failure Effect: The cook is diseased. While diseased, the cook can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 7 (2d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the cook instantly transforms into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation
