Don't let these small, gnarly, deep crimson peppers fool you. They have a fiery punch! 

After eating the pepper, the person eating them makes a constitution saving throw DC 13 and upon a fail, deals 1d4 fire damage to themself.  In addition, you must use your next bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 15 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
