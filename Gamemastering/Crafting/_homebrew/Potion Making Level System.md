## Potion Making Level System

Practice makes perfect. This also goes for the art of potion crafting.  

Each time a player identifies or successfully gathers an ingredient, studies to learn a new recipe or successfully completes a product an amount of Potion Making Exp. is awarded according to rarity and quantity. The values of those are depicted in the table below. A player's Potion Making level applies equally to each of the three kits.

| EXP.      | Identify | Gather | Produced | Recipe learned |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | -------- | -------------- |
| Common    | 5        | 2      | 80       | 60             |
| Uncommon  | 10       | 8      | 200      | 150            |
| Rare      | 20       | 12     | 750      | 500            |
| Very Rare |          | 20     | 2000     | 1500           |
| Legendary |          | 40     |          |                |

When a player investigates an area, they get a reward for each herb ingredient identified, based on rarity. No Exp. reward is obtained from identifying animals. A player can only receive Exp. once for identifying an herb in an area. Subsequent investigation can be performed to find rarer ingredients, awarding Exp. to the player only for newly identified ingredients. So, if the player identifies Gillyweed, Red Aminata Mushrooms and Stinging Nettles during the same investigation, they receive 5 + 5 + 10 = 20 Exp. If the player investigates the area again, rolls higher and identifies Gillyweed, Red Aminata Mushrooms, Stinging nettles, Hagfinger and Moonstalker, the player receives an additional 20 + 20  = 40 Exp.

Once a player has identified ingredients and successfully collects them, they get a reward for each unit of that ingredient acquired, based on rarity. So, if a player successfully harvests 4 vials of Purple Worm Poison, they receive 4 * 40 = 160 Exp.

The player can also obtain Potion Making Exp. for learning new recipes and producing potions or other products, depending on rarity. Recipes can only be learned once (the recipe learning process is described on page 3). No Exp. Is awarded to recipes learned via character leveling. 

An Excel spreadsheet with all ingredient rarities is also available: (<https://drive.google.com/file/d/14KB0KTRPMHxkBGut_D4Mu8OqQBhrIe5V/view?usp=sharing>). This spreadsheet can also be used to automatically record the players Exp., ingredient stock, product stock and Potion Making Level. The file is nonfunctional in Drive, but can be downloaded as a .xlsx file.

### Potion making modifier
Once the player has reached a certain Exp. value, they level up their potion making abilities to a maximum of level 10. Each level above level 1 provides a cumulative +1 to check made to determine if a potion was made successfully.
