# Potion Brewing and Ingredient Gathering

##### A Supplementary Guide to DnD 5e for Expanded Features of the Alchemy, Herbology and Poison Kits

## Recipes

### Using a Recipe
An asterisk (*) next to a recipe means that the item is not an official item in D&D. The cost of a recipe includes any mundane ingredients and equipment, which are assumed to be included with the appropriate tool. Ingredients specifically listed are considered to be 1 unit (such as flowers, bunches, or vials) unless otherwise specified.

### Developing new Recipes
When your proficiency bonus increases, you can add a new recipe to your recipes known. This recipe must be of an appropriate level or lower, as indicated by the Discovering Recipes Table below. The table excludes Minor Potions, who are instead explained on page 14. If the player gets a higher proficiency bonus, they can instantly learn a new recipe without any cost or time investment. 

This also happens retroactively when becoming proficient with the tool after obtaining a higher proficiency bonus.

| Proficiency Bonus | Recipe Level |
|:-----------------:| ------------ |
|        +2         | Common (3)   |
|        +3         | Uncommon     |
|        +4         | Uncommon     |
|        +5         | Rare         |
|        +6         | Very Rare    |

### Learning new Recipes
When you come across a new recipe, you add it to your recipes known. To become proficient and use the recipe requires time and money spent in experimentation, as indicated by the Recipes Table below.

Learning a new recipe always succeeds, but does not result in any product.

| Recipe Level | Time      | Cost    |
| ------------ | --------- | ------- |
| Common (3)   | 8 hours   | 50 gp   |
| Uncommon     | 40 hours  | 250 gp  |
| Rare         | 80 hours  | 500 gp  |
| Very Rare    | 240 hours | 1000 gp |

### Pricing Guide
Potions, poisons and other products have set prices based on their rarity. This cost is paid up front once the production is started. The price of ingredients used is subtracted from this price. The price of the product depends on its rarity and can be found in the table below. 

If a potion making Check is failed, the original ingredients are returned, though gold spent is lost.

| Ingredient Rarity | Cost   |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Common            | 5 gp   |
| Uncommon          | 10 gp  |
| Rare              | 50 gp  |
| Very Rare         | 150 gp |
| Legendary         | 500 gp |

Items have 2 rarities: their gather rarity and their pricing rarity. The gather rarity refers to how hard the source of the ingredient is to find in the wild. The pricing rarity is what determines the value of an ingredient in the total price of a potion, poison or other product.
