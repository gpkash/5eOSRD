# Hammers of Grimjaws

The **Hammers of Grimjaws** are the highest ranking and most elite order of [[paladins]] who dedicate their lives and services to [[Tyr]].

## Membership

Members of the Grimjaws are sponsored by existing members from the ranks of only two orders of Tyr, the [[5eOSRD/Worlds/Forgotten Realms/Deities/Tyr/Knights of Holy Judgement]] and the [[5eOSRD/Worlds/Forgotten Realms/Deities/Tyr/Knights of the Merciful Sword|Knights of the Merciful Sword]].

### Vision

The choosing of the Hammers' members is in part done by [[Tyr]] himself, in order to ascend the order's ranks, a candidate must pray and receive a vision from [[Tyr]]. A vision of [[Tyr]]'s warhammer shows the god's favor and permits immediate acceptance into the order. A vision of [[Tyr]]'s sword means that the aspiring Hammer has failed in some way and must atone before entering the ranks. A successful atonement quest allows the aspirant to join the Order as though he had seen the vision of the warhammer. Currently there are less than 12 Hammers in active service, a testament to the purity and power required to become one of the order.
