# Knights of the Merciful Sword

The **Knights of the Merciful Sword** were an order of [[paladins]] that faithfully focused on the "good" tenets of their patron deity [[Tyr]].

The Knights were very close to the [[Knights of Holy Judgment]], both of whose members were the only faithful of [[Tyr]] who were eligible to join the ranks of the [[Hammers of Grimjaws]].
