# Yondalla

**Yondalla** (pronounced: _yon-DAH-lah_) was the creator of the [[halfling]] race and matriarch of not only the halfling pantheon, but the whole race itself. With her charming personality and friendly demeanor she was an example to all halflings; who almost all shared her curiosity, loyalty and sense of mischief.

## Relationships

Yondalla had close bonds with [Garl Glittergold](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Garl_Glittergold "Garl Glittergold"), [Corellon Larethian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Corellon_Larethian "Corellon Larethian") and [Moradin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moradin "Moradin"). With the passion with which she loved and admired her fellow halfling deities, sometimes known as 'Yondalla's Children', she scorned certain evil deities, such as [Bane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bane "Bane"), [Cyric](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cyric "Cyric"), [Talona](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Talona "Talona"), [Talos](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Talos "Talos"), and the [Deities of Fury](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Deities_of_Fury "Deities of Fury").

## Worshipers

> “Fill my cup with plenty, mother. May it never run dry.”
> — A basic prayer to Yondalla.

Despite her widespread worship among halflings and her central role in their society; her temples were unusually rare, those that did exist were designed to look like a well-hidden halfling burrow-home and were filled with weapons and food so that the communities that surrounded them could hold out against possible invaders. Her clergy were afforded a lot of respect by the followers of other gods for their defensive capabilities in spite of their small stature.

Powerful clerics of Yondalla were granted the ability to cast _[Curse of Yondalla](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Curse_of_Yondalla "Curse of Yondalla")_, a spell reserved to be used against those who committed foul crimes against halflings.
