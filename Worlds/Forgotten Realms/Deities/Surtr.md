# Surtr

**Surtr** was worshiped as the [giant god](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_pantheon "Giant pantheon") of the [fire giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_giant "Fire giant").

## Description

Surtur looked like an immensely large fire giant with crackling flames in place of hair and eyebrows.

## Possessions

Surtur's signature weapon was a [greatsword](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Greatsword "Greatsword"), wreathed in flame and 15 feet (4.6 meters) in length. He was also known to wear [iron](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Iron "Iron") armor that was incredibly hot.

## Realm

Surtur ruled Muspelheim. In the [World Tree cosmology](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/World_Tree_cosmology "World Tree cosmology") this ever-burning realm was part of the [Neutral Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Neutral_Plane "Neutral Plane") of [Jotunheim](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jotunheim "Jotunheim") and was connected by a [portal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Portal "Portal") to the [Elemental Plane of Fire](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Plane_of_Fire "Elemental Plane of Fire"). In the [Great Wheel cosmology](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Wheel_cosmology "Great Wheel cosmology") it was located on the fiery second layer of the [plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Plane "Plane") of [Ysgard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ysgard "Ysgard"); the layer was also called [Muspelheim](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Muspelheim "Muspelheim"), named for Surtur's realm. In addition, Surtur shared the realm of Jotunheim on the [layer of Ysgard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ysgard_(layer) "Ysgard (layer)") with [Thrym](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thrym "Thrym"), where the Lord of the Fire Giants resided in the ancient hall of Meerrauk.

## Worshipers

Nearly all of Surtur's worshipers were giants. A select few members of other races were known to have earned his approval, but they concealed their devotion to the giant lord.

Surtur taught that [fire](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fire "Fire") was pure, cleansing, and strong. The weak and impure burned, while the strong survived. Fire was useful as a tool, but must be respected. It was dangerous when uncontrolled.

Surtr's temples in the lands of men were hidden affairs. Those that were not hidden were huge buildings ringing with the sounds of forges and storing weapons in preparation for the battle at the end of the world. Visitors had only a few seconds to prove their intentions before the fire giants attacked. Fire giants did not enjoy leaving witnesses to their activities.

## History

Surtur, a son of [Annam](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Annam "Annam"), was part of the second generation of giantish deities, born at about the same time as [Skoraeus Stonebones](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Skoraeus_Stonebones "Skoraeus Stonebones") and [Thrym](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thrym "Thrym").
