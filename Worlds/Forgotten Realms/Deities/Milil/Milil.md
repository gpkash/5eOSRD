# Milil

Milil (pronounced: /mɪlˈlɪl/ mil-LILL or: /mɛˈlɪl/ meh-LILL) was venerated as the Faerûnian lesser deity of song, poetry, eloquence, creativity, and inspiration. He represented the whole song rather than just one part, such as the music or lyrics—not just the finished thought, but the whole process that took an idea from its conception to its completion. In the mindset encouraged by the Lord of Song, life itself was like a song, beginning at birth and ending upon death.

### Description

Milil appeared as a young, charismatic 10 feet (3 meters) tall male with shoulder-length golden hair, indistinguishable as either [[human]] or [[elf]]. His clean, handsome good looks were exceeded only by his hauntingly beautiful voice. He dressed in the bright, elegantly patterned clothes of a troubadour accented with gold jewelry and other eye-catching decorations.

### Manifestations

Milil often appeared on [[Toril]] as haunting music or as a beautiful disembodied male voice that resonated within woodland clearings. He enjoyed planting beneficial visions in the minds of performers and artists that pleased him, which included locations of treasure or the whereabouts of long-lost loved ones. Another favored manifestation of Milil was that of a shimmering radiance emanating from a [[5eOSRD/Characterizations/Classes/Bard|bard]], poet, or other performer who was in the throes of inspiration at the pinnacle of a performance. The sight of this brilliant aura could move audiences to tears, prompt generous donations and offerings, or cause them to act in blindfolded obedience to the performing artist.

To signify his approval of artistic work—whether it be a song, epic poem, theatrical performance, or the like—Milil would conjure a golden-lined image of two dancing hollyphants. This appeared out of thin air or, if on parchment, as what seemed like glowing yellow ink.

### Personality

Milil was a consummate performer and possessed a confident, constantly inspired personality. He had an impeccable memory as well as a broad knowledge of lore from across [[Toril]] that served to bolster his facile improvisations. However, Milil was also quite egotistical and adored being the center of attention, becoming easily bored when this wasn’t the case. He was extremely flirtatious with both mortals and other [[deities]] alike.

### Powers

Along with his vast knowledge of many magical spells, particularly those from the charm school of magic, Milil’s singing voice could destroy any magical silencing effects and pacify any beings within his vicinity. He could masterfully play any instrument and had perfect memory of any song heard by him or any priest in his service. Milil was immune to any spells or effects of a vocal or musical manifestation and, by touch, could cause or confer deafness or impart the specific knowledge of a song—including exact tune and lyrics—so that it might never be forgotten by the recipient.

### Possessions

Milil’s favored weapon was Sharptongue, a magical [[rapier]] he would, on occasion, lend to mortals performing great quests in his honor. He could also conjure a harp of magical flames, which was a favored display to demonstrate his divinity.

### Relationships

As a deity, Milil, along with [[Deneir]] and [[Gond]], served the greater power of [[Oghma]]. Despite this shared service, Milil had little in common with [[Gond]], and they had a slightly strained relationship.

Milil maintained very good relations with a number of powerful gods, including [[Mystra]], [[Sune]], and [[Lliira]], as well as with the gods of the elven pantheon. He felt that Finder Wyvernspur showed some promise, but Finder did not feel the same about Milil.

After Milil made a mocking ballad about [[Cyric]] and his insanity, the Prince of Lies became an enemy of the Lord of Song.

  
### Worshipers

He was predominantly worshiped by [[human]], [[elf]], and [[half-elf]] bards but attracted other musically inclined individuals such as troubadours and poets. The faith of Milil was an organized group that attracted attractive, sensual, and musically inclined followers. In addition to their affinity with song and musical instruments, they tended to appreciate good food and wine, and the beauty found in both nature and civilized society. The church was composed primarily of clerics but also included bards, mystics, and spellsingers.

  

### Orders

**Harmonious Order:** This group of personable and swaggering paladins encouraged bards to accompany them to create ballads based on their exploits taken in Milil’s name.

  
### History

In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, Ayryn Farlight held a [[scrying]] session for select members of the Society of Sensation, using her sorcerous gift to observe various [[deities]] of [[Toril]]. When she attempted to scry [[Tymora]], her magic sight was redirected by the goddess to observing Jasmine and Joel of Finder Wyvernspur’s Band. Eventually, her sight was focused on Milil, who was delighted to have an audience. The deity used magic to affix the [[scrying]] and performed the following songs: “The Baker’s Daughter,” a jaunty hin tune known as “Pipeweed Dreams,” a lengthy ballad called “The Seven Sisters,” “Three Thayvian Roses,” “The Purple Dragons of Cormyr,” and a number of Faerûnian folk songs about such mundane things as milking cows, weather, and crops. Eventually, the Sensates started getting bored of the performance, and Milil responded by starting to sing an opera—“The Fall of Myth Drannor.” The long and torturous performance was a punishment for trying to spy on a god.

During the Era of Upheaval, Milil was simply an exarch of [[Oghma]].

Soon after making a mocking ballad about [[Cyric]], Milil was ejected from the pantheon and banished to the Fugue Plane. As a result, musical prayers went out of fashion among bards. Some time before the late Year of Lost Ships, 1400 DR, the Lord of Song was rescued by a mysterious being called [[Withers]], who pulled him out of the Fugue Plane. However, as payment, Milil had to “honor the worthy” whenever [[Withers]] asked him to—a favor he was eternally invoking.
