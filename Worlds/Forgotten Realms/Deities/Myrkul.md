# Myrkul

**Myrkul** (pronounced: _MER-kul_) was a god of the dead and later a god of decay and exhaustion in the [Faerûnian pantheon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBnian_pantheon "Faerûnian pantheon").[4][16] He was originally a mortal man, a [necromancer](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Necromancer "Necromancer") named **Myrkul Bey al-Kursi**, who ascended to [godhood](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Gods "Dark Gods") alongside [[Bhaal]], the god of murder, and [[5eOSRD/Worlds/Deities/Bane]], god of tyranny.[17] His portfolio and home, the [[Bone Castle]], were both usurped by the mortal [[Cyric]] and later passed on to the ascended [[Kelemvor]].[16] However, as that which is dead can never truly die, Myrkul was worshiped as a god once more in the 15th century [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR"), **the Reaper** who brought more souls for the new Lord of the Dead to judge.[4] The face of the **Lord of Bones**,[4] the white skull shrouded in a black cowl, was recognized across the Realms as the symbol of fear and death, the paragon of nightmares.[6]

> *“But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win… All things must die—even gods.”*
— Myrkul Bey al-Kursi[18][19]

## Description

As a mortal, Myrkul Bey al-Kursi was described as a reticent and withdrawn individual. His thin frame and gangly limbs were hidden behind dark [robes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Robe "Robe"), and he spoke in a high-pitched but soft voice.[2]

The [avatar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar "Avatar") of Myrkul appeared as a [skeleton](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton "Skeleton") of a man hidden in flowing black robes. His wrinkled, lesioned skin and blackened, cracked lips gave the appearance he was just on the verge of death. He spoke in a rather high whisper, though his words never showed enough inflection to convey feeling or concern.[6]

## Personality

It was very important to Myrkul that Faerûnians always kept him in the back of their mind. He had mastered the skill of sparking unease and fear amongst mortals through every action or mere word and never missed an opportunity to remind the world that he was waiting for them all.[6]

## Powers

“

_I am the smile of the worm-cleansed skull. I am the regrets of those who remain, and the restlessness of those who are gone. I am the haunt of mausoleums, the god of graves and age, of dust and dusk. I am Myrkul, and you have slain my Chosen. But it is no matter, for I am Death. And I am not the end—I am a beginning._

”

— Myrkul as he raised Ketheric Thorm as his avatar, the Apostle of Myrkul.[20]

When Myrkul's avatar appeared in the realms, his mere touch could _[disrupt the life force](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chill_touch "Chill touch")_ of non-divine living beings, siphon away their strength, or even inflict [mummy rot](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mummy_rot "Mummy rot") upon them. Likewise, his touch could also immediately reanimate any dead being into an [undead](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Undead "Undead") form or create undead at will.[6]

## Realm

Myrkul ruled from the realm of the [Bone Castle](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Castle "Bone Castle"), within the [Gray Wastes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gray_Waste "Gray Waste"). After the [Time of Troubles](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Time_of_Troubles "Time of Troubles"), it was sent adrift on the [Astral Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Plane "Astral Plane").[6]

## Relationships

From his mortal life and well into godhood, Myrkul maintained a complicated kinship, if not outright friendship, with Bane and Bhaal.[17] He counted [Shar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shar "Shar") as an ally and [Chauntea](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chauntea "Chauntea"), [Lathander](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lathander "Lathander") and [Mielikki](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mielikki "Mielikki") among his foes, though the latter was likely a much longer list.[6]

Despite his death, whom his faithful referred to as _Cyruk_, the transition of Myrkulyte mausoleums to Cyricist temples was a smooth and painless transition.[8]

## Worshipers

_Main article: [Church of Myrkul](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Church_of_Myrkul "Church of Myrkul")_

The worship of Myrkul was never popular in [Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn "Faerûn"), his influence inspired through the fear of death.[6] He wasn't widely worshiped so much as dreaded, and even blamed for the natural difficulties that accompanied growing old.[4]

His worshipers, who were often undertakers in one form or another, were a morose, secretive lot, reticent to share their faith with those outside his meager and unorganized church.[4] These Myrkulytes were tasked with ensuring the people of [Toril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril "Toril") both feared and respected death. To aggrandize Myrkul's power they would propagate rumors that merely touching one of his priests would bring certain death.[8]

Following the [Avatar Crisis](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar_Crisis "Avatar Crisis"), Myrkul's worship continued on in part due to the efforts of the [horned harbingers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Horned_harbinger "Horned harbinger"), those beings that each came into contact with a [remnant](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Crown_of_Horns "Crown of Horns") of the god's divinity.[21]

### Symbol

The [holy symbol](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_symbol "Holy symbol") of Myrkul was a white skull inset into a black triangle.[4]

## History

### Mortal Life

As a mortal, Myrkul's full name and title was said to have been _Myrkul Bey al-Kursi_, Crown Prince of [Murghôm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Murgh%C3%B4m "Murghôm").[22] He was a powerful adventuring [necromancer](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Necromancer "Necromancer"), traveling with Bane and Bhaal his mortal years _circa_ the Shadowed Age of ancient [Netheril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netheril "Netheril"), each dedicated to a quest to attain divinity for themselves. The trio scoured the Realms for power and information to get closer to godhood, and eventually managed to slay one of the [Seven Lost Gods](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Seven_Lost_Gods "Seven Lost Gods") in the [Year of Sycophants, −357 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/-357_DR "-357 DR"). That year they led a coalition of forces drawn from the [Moonsea North](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moonsea_North "Moonsea North"), and slew [Maram of the Great Spear](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Maram_of_the_Great_Spear "Maram of the Great Spear") at the [Monument of the Ancients](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Monument_of_the_Ancients "Monument of the Ancients") in the [Frozen Forest](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Frozen_Forest "Frozen Forest").[23] Having gained some [divine](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Divine "Divine") power, they embarked into the [Gray Waste](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gray_Waste "Gray Waste"), and after slaying legions of [undead](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Undead "Undead"), stood before the Lord of the End of Everything, [Jergal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jergal "Jergal").[17]

The ancient god had grown tired of his reign and freely agreed to hand over his dominion of the underworld. As the three could not decide who among them would sit upon the throne of the dead, they left the decision to chance with a game of [knucklebones](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Knucklebones "Knucklebones"). Bane emerged the winner and declared himself "ruler for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant". Myrkul had come in second place and his decision seemed to out-maneuver the Black Lord.[17]

So Myrkul ascended, or rather descended, as the _Lord of the Dead_, ruler of the [underworld](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hades "Hades").[17] While he would never have the predominant worship that Bane, or even Bhaal, had in [Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn "Faerûn") he became a symbol of fear that every mortal would recognize and remember.[24]

### Betrayer's Crusade

“

Death walks behind each of us, every day. Nay, don't look back nor try to run—none can outrun his fate, though many try strange and elaborate ways of doing so. Death is patient and comes for you when he's ready—oft when you least expect him and least want him. It's the way of Death.

”

— Oren Bel Danarr, Sage of Triel, _Musings on the Realms_[25]

When the [Rashemen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rashemen "Rashemen") city of [Mulsantir](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mulsantir "Mulsantir") was ravaged by a plague known as the Black Whisper, only two [priests](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Priest "Priest"), both of them faithful to Myrkul, were willing and able to tend [Rashemi](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rashemi "Rashemi") that died within the streets. As a rare symbol of recompense, the Lord of the Dead retrieved the _[Silver Sword of Gith](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Silver_Sword_of_Gith "Silver Sword of Gith")_ from the [Abyss](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abyss "Abyss") and presented it to his follower, [Akachi](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Akachi "Akachi"). Myrkul anointed him as his [chosen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chosen "Chosen")and directed him to continue his teachings in Faerûn.[26]

When Akachi's [faithless](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faithless "Faithless") [lover](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Founder "Founder") died in an accidental [arcane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arcane "Arcane") backfire, the priest knew her soul would be lost to the [Wall of the Faithless](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wall_of_the_Faithless "Wall of the Faithless") in the [City of Judgement](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/City_of_Judgement "City of Judgement"). He begged Myrkul to spare her from this fate, but the Lord of Bones refused. Filled with anger and sorrow, Akachi renounced his god, and along with his brother [Araman](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Araman "Araman"), assembled group to march on the City of Judgement by means of the Betrayer's Gate, tear down the wall and retrieve his beloved.[26]

Akachi's crusaders were met on the [Fugue Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fugue_Plane "Fugue Plane") by Myrkul himself, who led an army comprised of ancient heroes, a horde of [devils](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Devil "Devil") from the Abyss and those judged to have broken oaths with their deities. During the ensuing battle, Myrkul broke through Akachi's forces and had the former Chosen bound in chains and dragged to the basilica to face judgement. He was denounced as one of ["the False"](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/False "False"), and rather than be banished to the City of Judgement, was cursed to roam Faerûn as the _faceless man_, an abomination with an insatiable hunger for the souls of others that became known as the Spirit-Eater. Myrkul handed down this punishment as a sort of contingency plan that ensured the people of Toril would always fear his name.[26]

### Time of Troubles

Many years later, Myrkul again allied himself with Bane and the two dark gods conspired to steal the [Tablets of Fate](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tablets_of_Fate "Tablets of Fate") from the overgod [Ao](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ao "Ao"), in hopes that the loss of these tablets would weaken him enough that he could be overthrown.[27] In response, the gods were banished from their respective Realms, forced to live on Toril in [avatars](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar "Avatar") that held a mere fraction of their divine power.[28]

Sometime in the first half of the year [1358 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1358_DR "1358 DR"), the gods appeared in the Realm of Faerûn. While it was unclear where Myrkul first turned up, at one point he traveled to the [Goldenfields](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Goldenfields "Goldenfields"), a temple dedicated to the Earthmother [Chauntea](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chauntea "Chauntea"), where he fought the High Priest [Tolgar Anuvien](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tolgar_Anuvien "Tolgar Anuvien"). Myrkul was stopped from destroying the temple outright, but he left Anuvien dying on the ground after their battle.[29]

On [Eleasis 13](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Eleasis_13 "Eleasis 13"),[30] Myrkul assisted Bane with their continued pursuit of the tablets and had his clergy work to create and cast a mass-scale _[death spell](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Death_spell "Death spell")_ that, by use of their true names, killed all of the [assassins](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Assassin "Assassin") throughout Faerûn. These souls were consumed by Bane and his worshipers in an ultimately futile attempt for the Black Lord to assault the [Temple of Torm's Coming](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Temple_of_Torm%27s_Coming "Temple of Torm's Coming") in the city of [Tantras](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tantras "Tantras"), where one of the tablets rested under guard.[29]

It was unknown exactly when, but Myrkul learned of the location of the other Tablet of Fate and recovered it to his realm, the Great Waste.[31] Remaining in his realm with his tablet, Myrkul sent his [night riders](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Night_rider "Night rider") to intercept the mortal [Midnight](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Midnight "Midnight")at [High Horn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/High_Horn_(hold) "High Horn (hold)"), as he knew her to be in possession of the other divine artifact.[32]

After Midnight and her companions arrived at [Waterdeep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep "Waterdeep"), Myrkul followed from Hades through the Pool of Loss beneath the [Yawning Portal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yawning_Portal "Yawning Portal") inn. He rode through the city with a horde of undead and [fiendish](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fiend "Fiend") minions, finding Midnight, her allies and the remaining Tablet of Fate taking refuge in [Blackstaff Tower](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Blackstaff_Tower "Blackstaff Tower").[33] He briefly reunited the two divine slabs and ascended the spire towards the [Celestial Stairway](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Celestial_Stairway "Celestial Stairway"). A magnificent battle ensued on the tower's roof, and when the Lord of Bones was distracted by a swooping [griffon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Griffon "Griffon") he was _[disintegrated](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Disintegrate "Disintegrate")_ by the young mage whom he had been pursuing. The avatar of Myrkul was destroyed in an eruption of plague and death.[34] Some of the dust from this explosion drifted far to the north and came to rest in the [Mere of Dead Men](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mere_of_Dead_Men "Mere of Dead Men") southeast of [Neverwinter](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Neverwinter "Neverwinter"), causing outbreaks of [undead](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Undead "Undead") from ancient battles in the area.[35]

### Crown of Horns

As Myrkul's avatar was slain, just before the majority of his power was transferred to Cyric during his ascension, the last remnants of his energy entered into the _[Crown of Horns](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Crown_of_Horns "Crown of Horns")_, which was locked away within a vault inside [Khelben "Blackstaff"'s](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Khelben_Arunsun "Khelben Arunsun") tower. The ancient [Netherese](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Netherese "Netherese") artifact held what was left of his personality and memories for a decade, after which it reformed its physical form on Toril. By Myrkul's lingering will, the crown transported around Faerûn to a number of hosts, allowing the god to maintain his influence among the mortals, as he ever did, sowing dissent and fear via suggestion and influence.[36] Among those that wore the crown were [Aumvor "the Undying"](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aumvor "Aumvor")[37] and the [Yuan-ti pureblood](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yuan-ti_pureblood "Yuan-ti pureblood"), [Nhyris D'Hothek](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Nhyris_D%27Hothek "Nhyris D'Hothek").[36]

### Third Crusade of the Faithless

In [1374 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1374_DR "1374 DR"), while escaping from the [Academy of Shapers and Binders](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Academy_of_Shapers_and_Binders "Academy of Shapers and Binders") in [Thay](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thay "Thay"), the [Kalach-Cha](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kalach-Cha "Kalach-Cha") passed through a portal to the [Astral Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Plane "Astral Plane") and happened upon Myrkul's corpse, spending some time conversing with the nearly-dead god on the nature of the Spirit-Eater curse.[26]

### 15th Century

While many were converted to the worship of Cyric,[38] and later Kelemvor,[26]there were several minor shrines of Myrkul that survived through the [Spellplague](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spellplague "Spellplague")and past the [Second Sundering](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Sundering "Second Sundering"). Following this cataclysmic event, the Lord of the Dead was restored as one of the gods[4] of [death](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Death_domain "Death domain"), sharing aspects of his domain ironically enough with Jergal, in service of Kelemvor, despite the opposing viewpoints of their faithful.[9][39][11]

In the later years of the century, Myrkul was a [quasi-deity](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Quasi-deity "Quasi-deity") that remained in mortal form.[1] In the [Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1492_DR "1492 DR"), the Lord of Bones' [Chosen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chosen "Chosen"), [Ketheric Thorm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ketheric_Thorm "Ketheric Thorm"), sacrificed himself to Myrkul in a last-ditch effort to defeat a party of [True Soul](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/True_Soul "True Soul") [adventurers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Adventurer "Adventurer") who had pursued him beneath [Moonrise Towers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moonrise_Towers "Moonrise Towers"), resulting in Ketheric being resurrected as an avatar of Myrkul.[20]
