# Malar

**Malar** (pronounced: _MAHL-arr_ or:_MAY-larr) was the lesser deity of hunting, stalking, bloodlust, and bestial savagery in the Faerûnian pantheon. **The Beastlord** was the epitome of the dark, bloody side of nature. In his more favorable aspects, he was worshiped by those who identified with the wild natures, as well as the grace and amorality of predators. Despite being revered among druid circles as the hunger and hunting instinct of beasts, he despised The Balance of nature that druids and other nature deities sought to uphold.

In the past he was a member of the Gods of Fury led by Talos, becoming an exarch] of Silvanus after the Spellplague.

## Description

Malar had two favored forms when he was prowling the Realms: the Beast and the Master of the Hunt. As the Beast, he was a 12  feet (3.7 meters) long, man-high feline creature, sleek and supple in his movements. His ebony fur was matted with blood, which dripped endlessly from his talons and fangs, and he could not speak in this form. The Master of the Hunt meanwhile was humanoid and as tall as the Beast was long, though it too had black fur. Above his red eyes was a large rack of antlers able to melt away and reappear at his will, while below them was a whuffling, flesh-draped hole rather than a nose and mouth. Though able to speak in this form, he only did so in a low, growling undertone or vicious snarl.

## Relationships

Malar was one of the Deities of Fury, led by Talos. He held a long-standing alliance with Lolth against the Seldarine, and other dark deities like Bane and Loviatar. He fought against deities of peace, civilization, and nature, but held particular hate for Nobanion for defeating him in a battle during the Time of Troubles.

After the events of the Spellplague, Malar became subject to Silvanus' rule as a resident of the Deep Wilds. Despite this, Silvanus did not rein in Malar.

## Worshipers

Malar was a minor deity not unique to Toril, a divine scavenger who foraged for worshipers among perhaps a hundred predatory races across an equally vast number of worlds. Malarites were generally frowned upon by civilization, as they tended to wreak havoc in their wake. One exception where the worship of Malar was allowed was in Cormyr.

The People of the Black Blood were tribes of Lycanthropes that venerated Malar. In the Year of Wild Magic, it was estimated that the total population was at least 3,000 individuals scattered across the forests of Faerûn in groups of fifty to one hundred.

### Dogma

Malarites believed that it was an honor to Malar to make one's killing bloody and long. His followers sometimes formed in bands, called "Hunts". While forbidden to slay the young or the pregnant, Hunts typically followed his dogma and evoked wanton slaughter in Malar's name.

### Holy Days

The High Hunt ritual was a vicious hunt in which a captured humanoid was released, and for the next day and night attempted to escape the prowling worshipers of the Beastlord. If they managed to survive, they won their freedom as well as, perhaps, other things.

The Feast of the Stags day made Malar's worship more tolerable in certain areas. For this event, all people were invited to partake of the bounty of the hunt, regardless of faith. At this time, priests of Malar chose some widows, orphans, elderly, or infirm citizens and promised to provide meat for their tables for the winter.

### Notable Worshipers

- [Garmos Saernclaws](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Garmos_Saernclaws "Garmos Saernclaws"), one of the most respected servants of Malar, responsible for the [gospel of Saernclaws](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gospel_of_Saernclaws "Gospel of Saernclaws") by which all priests of Malar were bound, ensuring that hunts remained clean and poison-free.

## History

At some point in the 1350s DR, [Pasha](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Pasha "Pasha") [Abon Duum](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abon_Duum "Abon Duum") of [Manshaka](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Manshaka "Manshaka") had fortuitously been granted guardianship of the [kittenlord](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kittenlord "Kittenlord"), heir to the power of the [cat lord](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cat_lord "Cat lord"), a minor power of felines. However, Duum desired to corrupt and dominate the child, and therefore made a deal with the mightier power Malar to keep the vengeful old [Catlord](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Catlord_(old) "Catlord (old)") off his back. Duum wished to use the cat lord's power of [planar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Planes "Planes") travel to journey into the [Outer Planes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Planes "Outer Planes") and, using the [Claw of Malar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Claw_of_Malar "Claw of Malar"), even challenge [Tyr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tyr "Tyr"), god of justice, and gain awesome power. In exchange, when he was done with the boy, Duum would give him to the Beastlord. Learning of Duum's wicked intentions for the boy, the Catlord came and rescued him, but Malar pounced upon the Catlord as he fled.)

The Catlord handed over the boy to the rogue [Conner](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Conner "Conner") (who'd been guided onto the scene by the goddess [[Selûne]], and to buy time for him to carry the child away and hide him, fought Malar. The Catlord and Malar battled for three days and three nights, before the Catlord escaped, and it was a year before his wounds even healed. The scars would not. However, in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR], Duum was tricked and thwarted and [[Tyr]] seized the Claw of Malar instead.

During the [Time of Troubles](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Time_of_Troubles "Time of Troubles") in 1358 DR, Malar's avatar battled [Sebek](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sebek "Sebek") in the [Adder Swamp](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Adder_Swamp "Adder Swamp") in a titanic battle that destroyed large areas of the region.
