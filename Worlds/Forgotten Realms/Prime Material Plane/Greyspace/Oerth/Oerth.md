# Oerth

**Oerth** (pronounced:  _OYth_ or:  _URth_[5] or:  _AYRth_)  was a planet located in the center of [Greyspace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Greyspace "Greyspace"), a [crystal sphere](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_sphere "Crystal sphere") located in the [Prime Material Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_Material_Plane "Prime Material Plane").

## Cosmography

Greyspace was part of a celestial configuration known as the Triad, which also included [Realmspace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Realmspace "Realmspace"), where the world of [Toril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril "Toril") was found, and [Krynnspace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Krynnspace "Krynnspace"), home of the world of [Krynn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Krynn "Krynn"). The [phlogiston](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Phlogiston "Phlogiston"), a rainbow-colored chaotic liquid that surrounded the spheres, had a strong current that flowed from Realmspace directly toward Greyspace, making travel in that direction relatively simple; due to this current, it was impossible to travel directly to Krynnspace from Realmspace. From Greyspace, however, it was a relatively simple matter to travel to either Realmspace or Krynnspace, with strong currents leading to both spheres. From Krynnspace, one could easily move to Realmspace, but travel directly to Greyspace from Krynnspace was impossible.[7]

## Geography

There was a land here called the Flanaess[8] and a body of water called the Coral Sea.[9]

### Calendar

Similarly to Toril, the inhabitants of Oerth used a number of different calendars to mark the time. The standard most commonly used was the Common Year (CY) calendar.[10] A year on Oerth lasted 365 [sidereal days](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sidereal_day "wikipedia:sidereal day"),[11] but as a result of the sun's orbit around the planet, a calendar year contained only 364 [solar days](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solar_day "wikipedia:solar day").[12][13][14][note 1]

The [Year of the Turret, 1360 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1360_DR "1360 DR") marked the first meeting between [Elminster](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elminster "Elminster") and [Mordenkainen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mordenkainen "Mordenkainen") on [Earth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Earth "Earth").[15][16] On Oerth, this was shortly before the year 581 CY, when Mordenkainen was beginning to suspect a plot to destroy the Circle of Eight, which culminated in [Vecna](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vecna "Vecna")'s first failed attempt at becoming a [greater deity](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Greater_deity "Greater deity").[17][18][note 2]

## History

In the mid‒14th century [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR"), Jewely Carseah and Marcus of the Waters were sent as emissaries from Oerth to the [Rock of Bral](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rock_of_Bral "Rock of Bral") to discuss the threat of invasion the [Vodoni Empire](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vodoni_Empire "Vodoni Empire") posed to the [crystal spheres](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_sphere "Crystal sphere") of [Realmspace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Realmspace "Realmspace"), Greyspace, and [Krynnspace](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Krynnspace "Krynnspace"), in the early stages of the [War of the Spheres](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Spheres "War of the Spheres"). The meeting marked the formation of the [Free Space Alliance](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Space_Alliance "Free Space Alliance").[19]

In the late 15th century [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR"), a book on the history of Oerth was part of the collection of the [arcanaloth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arcanaloth "Arcanaloth") headmaster of the [Dweomercore](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dweomercore "Dweomercore") level of [Undermountain](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Undermountain "Undermountain").[20]

## Inhabitants

Oerth was home to prominent wizards such as [Bigby](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bigby "Bigby"), [Drawmij](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drawmij "Drawmij"), [Tenser](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tenser "Tenser"), and Mordenkainen, whose spells were well known on [Toril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril "Toril"). Mordenkainen was an acquaintance of Elminster's; the two had met on numerous occasions in the home of [Ed of the Green Wood](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ed_Greenwood "Ed Greenwood") on [Earth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Earth "Earth") to exchange spells and lore.[21][note 3]Mordenkainen, when he had newly mastered interplanar travel, used to visit [Waterdeep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep "Waterdeep") with some regularity.[22]

When [Harkle Harpell](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Harkle_Harpell "Harkle Harpell") entered into an unorthodox contest of wizardry with the _[Sea Sprite](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_Sprite "Sea Sprite")'s_ wizard [Robillard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Robillard "Robillard"), Harkle and Robillard mentioned a number of Oerthly wizards, including Bigby, Melf, Otiluke, and Tenser. In particular, Robillard regarded Bigby as one of the most powerful and impressive wizards of all time, on any world.[23]

The Oerthly [bard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bard "Bard") Gwydiesin of the Cranes also chatted with Elminster on occasion.[24]

Both Elminster and [Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Khelben_%22Blackstaff%22_Arunsun "Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun") spent time on Oerth, and Elminster suspected that [Khelben Arunsun the Younger](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Khelben_Arunsun_the_Younger "Khelben Arunsun the Younger") settled there to begin a life away from the elder Khelben.[25]

Oerth was the homeworld of [Scaldulin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Scaldulin "Scaldulin"), a famous hero who wielded a powerful [enchanted](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Enchanted "Enchanted") [sword](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword "Sword"), the _[Hoarfrost Blade](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hoarfrost_Blade "Hoarfrost Blade")_. Before the blade ended up broken and then reforged on Toril, the sword accompanied its owner in the [Battle of the Thousand Dead](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Thousand_Dead "Battle of the Thousand Dead"), battle against [lich](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lich "Lich") [Scaroth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Scaroth "Scaroth") the Warped of [Blackmoor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Blackmoor "Blackmoor"), and stayed with its master after his transformation into a [death knight](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Death_knight "Death knight"). The sword also cut down a [solar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Solar "Solar") named [Arazium](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arazium "Arazium").[26]

## Culture

Large green plover's eggs were a delicacy in the Flanaess.[8]

### Notes

1. This difference in the number of days of the Oerthian year is due to the fact that the sun orbits Oerth in the same direction as the planet's rotation around its own axis. For that reason, every 365 times Oerth completes a full rotation around itself, the sun completes one, subtracting a day, for a total of 364 calendar days.
2. The year [1371 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1371_DR "1371 DR") appears to be equivalent to 591 in the Common Year (CY) timeline used in parts of Oerth, assuming the Forgotten Realms adventure _[For Duty & Deity](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/For_Duty_%26_Deity "For Duty & Deity")_ and the _[Planescape](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Planescape_Campaign_Setting "Planescape Campaign Setting")_ adventure _[Tales from the Infinite Staircase](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tales_from_the_Infinite_Staircase "Tales from the Infinite Staircase")_ (which were marketed as crossover adventures) both take place in late [1370 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1370_DR "1370 DR"), and assuming that the adventure _Die Vecna Die!_ (which includes scenes in the _Greyhawk_, _[Ravenloft](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ravenloft "Ravenloft")_, and _Planescape_settings) takes place a few months after _Tales from the Infinite Staircase_ and _[Faction War](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faction_War "Faction War")_, which seems evident from the political situation in [Sigil](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sigil "Sigil"). This is supported by [the Wizards Three](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wizards_Three "The Wizards Three") series in _Dragon_ Magazine. In [_Dragon_ #185](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_magazine_185 "Dragon magazine 185"), it's stated that the events of the novel _[The Parched Sea](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Parched_Sea "The Parched Sea")_, which takes place on [Toril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril "Toril"), have just recently occurred. "Novel Ideas" in [_Dragon_ #196](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_magazine_196 "Dragon magazine 196") places _The Parched Sea_ in [1360 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1360_DR "1360 DR"). _Dragon_ #185 also places the meeting described in that article prior to the events of the adventure _Vecna Lives_ (which happened in 581 CY according to the Greyhawk supplement _The Adventure Begins_), which suggests that 1360 DR approximately equals 580 CY.
