# Nashkel

**Nashkel** was a small town on the northern slopes of the [Cloud Peaks](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cloud_Peaks "Cloud Peaks").Although formally a part of [Amn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Amn "Amn"), Nashkel was separated from the rest of the kingdom by the mountain passes and as such, was relatively autonomous.

## History

Sometime before [Mirtul](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mirtul "Mirtul"), in the [Year of the Banner, 1368 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1368_DR "1368 DR"), the [Cyric](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cyric "Cyric") [cleric](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cleric "Cleric")[Mulahey](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mulahey "Mulahey") and his [kobold](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kobold "Kobold") minions began to contaminate the [iron](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Iron "Iron") mine outside of Nashkel. He did so under the direction of the bandit-leader [Tazok](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tazok "Tazok"), and by extension, [Rieltar Anchev](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rieltar_Anchev "Rieltar Anchev") of the [Iron Throne](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Throne "Iron Throne").

These events directly led to the [Iron crisis](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_crisis "Iron crisis") that plagued the [Sword Coast](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Coast "Sword Coast") in the same year. As tensions built up between Amn and the [Council of Four](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Four "Council of Four") of [Baldur's Gate](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate "Baldur's Gate"), Nashkel became a staging point for Amnian soldiers, as they prepared for battle against the [Flaming Fist](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Flaming_Fist "Flaming Fist").

That same year a traveling carnival came to Nashkel and set up just east of town. It featured a number of merchant stalls, gambling tents end even performers such as the Great Gazib and the Amazing Oopah.

[[Facts about Nashkel]]

Nashkel (Fortified Town)

Nashkel is the northernmost city of Amn, actually resting north of Amns established border in the Cloud Peaks. It is 2,000 feet above sea level, 500 feet above the cities of lost Minsorran and 200 feet higher than Imnescar. These factors give Nashkel the nicknames of the Cold City, Windy City, or Sloping City of Amn, as it rests on the low northern slopes of the Cloud Peaks. Nashkel is almost autonomous, as roads to it are often blocked by snows, but it still considers itself a part of Amn.

Population: 3,000 in town, 1,500 more in outlying villages and farms (98% human, 2% halfling, some shield dwarves).
Major Products: Caravan equipment, guides; local game and pelts, sheep and wool, barley, beer.

Places of Note:
Cloud Peaks Outfitters, an equipment shop for those traveling through the mountains (prices fair, products excellent). Salla Pitontoes (CG halff C4Tymora) has special supplies
(spidersilk ropes, a ring of feather falling, rock claws, etc.) for friends.

Icedawn's House, a shrine to the winter goddess Auril, is a small cabin up the slopes from Nashkel, wherein lives Jasha Istor (NE hf P8Auril). She will greet all travelers heading into the peaks, seeking donations to keep Auril's wrath away. Jasha is also one of the best guides through the Peaks from Nashkel, and her fees, while steep (twice any other), gain a party or caravan her spells protections from the wintery gales and snow. Jasha would be richer and her temple more opulent if she didn't scatter danters in the snow to assuage Auril's wrath. Many who wander the passes in summer find these gold coins; those who pick up one usually catch chills easily, and those who take more than one coin die of frostbite the next winter.
