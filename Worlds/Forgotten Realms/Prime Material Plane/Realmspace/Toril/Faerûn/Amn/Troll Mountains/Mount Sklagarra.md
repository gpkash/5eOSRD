# Mount Sklagarra

**Mount Sklagarra** was a peak in the [[Troll Mountains]] of [[Amn]] where the [[Heralds of Faerûn]] maintained their secret headquarters. It was east of the Smokespire volcano in the far west of the mountain range.

The mountain contained a vast underground lake with an island in the center surrounded by a large complex of caverns known as the Swordmere.
