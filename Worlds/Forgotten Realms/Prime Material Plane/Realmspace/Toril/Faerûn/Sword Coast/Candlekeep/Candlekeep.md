Standing atop a rocky crag overlooking the Sea of Swords, the massive citadel of Candlekeep has endured the elements for centuries and defied the degradations of time. Visible for miles around, Candlekeep has an eye-catching silhouette: a high wall interspersed with towers. This wall encloses a large space from which more towers rise. Those who behold the edifice say it looks like nothing so much as a cake decorated with an overabundance of candles.

The entrance to Candlekeep is a double gate that stands at the end of the Way of the Lion, the only road that provides access to and from the outside world. The route follows a lonely path across the peninsula where Candlekeep stands.

Those who gain entry discover a cloistered community of scholars milling around inside Candlekeep's walls, a place of enlightened conversation and friendly debate. No better place in the Realms exists for those who have a love for or a need of knowledge and who want to pursue such interests alongside fellow seekers.

Candlekeep has the largest repository of written lore in Faerûn, including the collected prophecies of an ancient [[Sage]] named [[Alaundo the Seer]]. Those compiled divinations make up a tiny fraction of the accumulated knowledge and secrets contained in the library's vast collection.

Not all knowledge preserved in Candlekeep is of historical importance. The library holds thousands upon thousands of lost recipes, old songs, collections of folklore, and journals written by folks whose time has long since passed. The abundance of these ancillary works makes finding notable tomes an exercise in patience and perseverance. Fortunately, a legion of scholars and sages called the Avowed look after the library and remain vigilant in the care and cataloging of all the knowledge it holds.

## Entering Candlekeep

The required entrance fee for admission into Candlekeep is a work of writing not already collected therein. Those who show up at the gates without such a gift are kindly but firmly turned away.

The enormous double gates of Candlekeep are three times the height of a [[human]] and wrought of black metal magically warded to foil attempts to damage them. Both doors are emblazoned with the sigil of Candlekeep. One of the two gates stands open far enough to admit visitors during the day, and the other is kept shut.

Bedecked in purple vestments, five Avowed **priests** of [[Deneir]] (god of writing) oversee the front gates, examining and discussing written works presented by hopefuls trying to gain entrance. If a question arises, the Avowed send a runner to consult with a [[Sage]] in the library. The runner eventually returns bearing a missive of acceptance or denial. Visiting scholars experienced in this procedure often bring a selection of possible donations to ensure admittance. Despite the stringent entrance requirements, the Avowed do accept rare editions of tomes already in the collection, journals of those who recount unique or insightful experiences, or the odd work that has been annotated by a prominent scholar outside the library. Once granted admission, visitors quickly discover that it's wise to assemble a "wish list" of works that members of the senior staff are interested in collecting, potentially reducing the guesswork of readmission on future visits.

Those admitted to Candlekeep, referred to as seekers, can request the assistance of an Avowed adjutant who acts as a guide and research assistant for the duration of their visit. This guide has access to all the resources of the library, with the exception of the vaults that contain the rarest and most dangerous works. Seekers can appeal to higher-ranking Avowed for permission to peruse these off-limits works.

### Securing a Guide

If the adventurers require a guide, roll a d8 and consult the Avowed Adjutants table to determine the adjutant who is assigned to them, or choose one that you like.

##### Avowed Adjutants

| 6  | Orrin Glass, a 67-year-old [[human]] scribe who is deaf in one ear, forgetful, and easily exasperated                                                |
| 7  | Vooshadi Moonriver, a stoic 87-year-old moon [[Elf]] scribe who is difficult to anger and doesn't mince words                                        |

## Defenses and Decorum

Candlekeep is fortified by a fifty-foot-tall, fifteen-foot-thick, iron-reinforced stone wall with a double gate facing east. Although most of the Avowed are humble scholars, a number of potent spellcasters fill critical posts. If trouble occurs, the [[Gatewarden]] (an **[[Archmage]]**) and up to four **mages** arrive to investigate immediately. If they can't bring the situation under control in short order, up to four additional **archmages** arrive to lend assistance.

### Wards

Numerous magical defenses protect the library. The most innocuous include wards to protect the library's books from mold, weevils, and other threats. Other protections are more dramatic, as discussed below.

***Magic Restriction.*** Wards prevent anyone from entering Candlekeep by any route other than through the front gates. Any attempt to magically bypass these gates fails. These wards do not prevent creatures from using magic to exit Candlekeep.

Anyone who tries to fly over the wall into Candlekeep is stopped short. Magical flight is dispelled, and the subject floats slowly to the ground fifty feet outside the gates. An intangible ward forces creatures that can fly naturally to either land or circumnavigate Candlekeep altogether. Ordinary birds are unaffected by this ward, and a clever [[wizard]] or other individual can bypass the ward by assuming the form of a Tiny bird. The Avowed don't discuss this flaw with outsiders, but anyone who can see the gulls flying over Candlekeep can easily reach the conclusion that certain creatures are exempt from this magical restriction. 

***Fire Suppression.*** Flames larger than a candle are suppressed within the keep. (The fireplace in the Hearth, Candlekeep's tavern, is an exception.) Thus, any spell that creates fire is wasted if it is cast within the keep.

***Theft Protection.*** Every book, scroll, and other work considered part of Candlekeep's collection is magically protected against theft. Any such work that is removed from the keep disappears and immediately returns to its proper place in the library.

This ward also has a flaw that the Avowed don't discuss with outsiders. If pages from a book or parts of a scroll are torn away, these fragments can be removed from Candlekeep as long as the bulk of the work remains in the library. Similarly, if a work is split into pieces and entirely removed from Candlekeep, only the largest piece disappears and returns to its proper place in the library.

***Shielding Mythal.*** From any location in Candlekeep, the [[Keeper of Tomes]] (see "The Avowed" later in this section) can activate a mythal—an exceptional, unbreakable magical effect—that envelops all of Candlekeep in a protective shield through which nothing but air and sound can pass.

### Orders of Accordance

All who enter Candlekeep must agree to the Orders of Accordance, rules set forth by the senior staff to prevent misconduct. Violating one or more of these orders results in banishment from Candlekeep, and the banished are seldom allowed to return. The rules are simple:

***No fighting.*** All arguments must follow the rules of cordial debate and discussion. Violent altercations are not tolerated.

***No stealing.*** This rule applies to all objects in the keep, not just the library's works.

***No copying.*** Visitors are permitted to take notes while studying the library's works, but anyone who wants to make a full copy of a work must pay to have the manuscript created by scribes at the House of the Binder.

***No damaging, marking, or otherwise modifying the works.*** This rule doesn't apply to privately owned books, scrolls, and other documents that aren't part of Candlekeep's collection.

## The Avowed

Roughly three hundred Avowed live in Candlekeep. The majority of them are low-level assistants, newcomers to the order, or scribes who handle the everyday work in the keep (use the **commoner** stat block to represent them).

High-ranking members of the Avowed include the individuals described below.

### [[Keeper of Tomes]]

In 1492 DR, the [[Keeper of Tomes]] is the [[human]] **[[Archmage]]** Janussi, a devoted follower of [[Deneir]].

### Readers

The [[Keeper of Tomes]] appoints individuals to fill key roles, as described in the sections that follow.

### [[First Reader]]

In 1492 DR, the First Reader is Bookwyrm, a [[dragonborn]] **master sage** of green dragon ancestry. Bookwyrm's real name is Skoda Valanaster.

### [[Great Readers]]

In 1492 DR, the Great Readers are:

- A'lai Aivenmore, a human **master sage** and worshiper of [[Oghma]] (god of knowledge). Primary expertise: divinity (the gods and the nature of the divine).

### Court of Air

This wide courtyard has nary a tree nor a well cluttering its cobblestone expanse.

[[House of Rest]]

[[The Hearth]]
- [[Little One]]

[[Bath and Steam House]]

[[House of the Binder]]

[[Pillars of Pedagogy]]

[[Temple of [[Oghma]]]]

[[Erudite Outfitters & Clothiers]]

[[Smithy and Stables]]

#### Emerald Door

The Emerald Door—the main point of access to the Inner Ward—stands at the western end of the Court of Air. It is fifteen feet tall and made of a translucent dark green stone that glows with an inner light. An *[[arcane lock]]* spell seals the door, which is further warded against all damage. Here, a Keeper of the Emerald Door (a **mage**) stands at all times to welcome newly arrived seekers. The Keeper uses runners to help seekers secure lodgings at the House of Rest and places to study in the Pillars of Pedagogy.

Keepers of the Emerald Door politely dispel any mistaken notions seekers might have about passing through the Emerald Door and exploring the Great Library beyond. The Inner Ward is off limits to seekers without special dispensation, which must come from the Keeper of Tomes, the First Reader, or one of the eight Great Readers. When permission to enter the Inner Ward is granted by such an individual, it's customary for the beneficiary of this consent to receive a signed and sealed letter of admittance. The wax seal must be intact and unbroken when the letter is presented to the Keeper of the Emerald Door. The Keeper determines the letter's authenticity by opening and reading it. If the letter passes muster, the Keeper returns it, opens the Emerald Door, and allows the letter's owner to enter the Inner Ward. Unless a shorter or longer duration is specified in the letter, permission to occupy the Inner Ward lasts for a tenday, during which time the letter's recipient can come and go as they please.

A Keeper can spot a forged letter of admittance with a successful Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check contested by the forger's Dexterity ([[Deception]]) check. Anyone caught presenting a forged letter is denied access to the Inner Ward indefinitely.

A seeker who is denied entry to the Inner Ward can still enjoy the bulk of Candlekeep's collected works. The seeker need only ask an Avowed adjutant to fetch the desired works and deliver them to the seeker's preferred place of study in Candlekeep (usually a chamber in the Pillars of Pedagogy). Not all books in the collection can be checked out in this manner, however; the rarest and most dangerous tomes can be accessed only by creatures who are granted passage through the Emerald Door.

If a request is made for a work that has been checked out by another Candlekeep resident, it could be days or weeks before that work becomes available.

### Inner Ward

The poster map included with this book shows the Inner Ward, which contains the Great Library—a veritable forest of stone towers clumped around stockier buildings, all joined together in the shadow of a high-walled citadel called Exaltation.

> ##### Extradimensional Spaces
>
>Candlekeep has invisible doorways to dozens of permanent extradimensional spaces, some as small as a room at an inn and others as large as the space created by a *[[demiplane]]* or *[[Mordenkainen]]'s [[magnificent mansion]]* spell. The Avowed try to keep track of all the extradimensional spaces in Candlekeep, but a few forgotten doorways lurk in the library, their locations or access requirements lost. Valuable books, scrolls, and other items might be trapped inside these extradimensional spaces.
>
>When an extradimensional space is rediscovered, it must be thoroughly explored, the resources within cataloged, and the space tested for its stability. When an extradimensional space is no longer needed or desired, the archmages of Candlekeep dispel it.

![The Sentinel Wyrm](007-01-005.miirym-the-sentinel-wyrm.png)

### Beneath Candlekeep

Secret staircases abound in Candlekeep, leading down to dusty vaults and catacombs that hold the oldest books. The flooded caves at sea level are haunted by all manner of strange creatures.

#### Miirym the Sentinel Wyrm

Well over 1,500 years ago, the silver dragon **Miirym** broke into Candlekeep, intent on adding its riches to her hoard. She devoured scholars and destroyed a score of irreplaceable books before she was confronted by an [[Archmage]] and bound into service to protect Candlekeep as penance for her misdeeds. The [[wizard]] passed away before **Miirym**'s sentence had been served, and other spellcasters were unable to break the enchantment that bound her.

Time passed and so did **Miirym**, whose corpse has long since crumbled into dust. Unfortunately for **Miirym**, the enchantment remains in effect on her spirit. The spectral dragon—what's left of her—dwells in the catacombs and caves under the library. Those who have visited the depths describe **Miirym** as a set of immense spectral jaws whose essence roils with the promise of breath weapons and spells of destruction.

Adventurers who explore the passages beneath Candlekeep might encounter **Miirym**, who's more interested in news of present-day Faerûn than in fighting. Indeed, **Miirym** is an engaging conversationalist if one has the inclination to chat with her.

**Miirym** doesn't have a treasure hoard. Instead, she protects the books and scrolls kept in her subterranean domain. The Sentinel Wyrm can be summoned by the Keeper of Tomes and called upon to defend Candlekeep from invaders who would plunder or destroy it. In her role as Candlekeep's defender, **Miirym** can move anywhere within the library fortress, passing through walls and other solid barriers. She can't enter extradimensional spaces, since they are not on the same plane of existence as Candlekeep. **Miirym**'s stat block appears at the end of this section.

#### Echoes of Alaundo

Shortly after [[Alaundo the Seer]] began speaking his prophecies, a wise novitiate devised a way to magically record his spoken words into prismatic gemstones now stored in a vault beneath Candlekeep. Only the First Reader and the Keeper of Tomes have the ability to coax audible recordings from these magic gemstones. Each one holds a prophecy spoken by Alaundo himself in an antiquated version of Common that is incomprehensible without the aid of magic. These gemstones came to be called the echoes of Alaundo.

Alaundo's prophecies are easily misinterpreted, which is why First Readers and Keepers of Tomes rarely consult or take advantage of the echoes.

#### Chamber of Lost Lore

Deep beneath Candlekeep, past **Miirym** and the echoes, is a rough-hewn chamber lit by *[[continual flame]]* spells. Here, one can gain the power to contact the spirits of long-dead sages that are willing to share their insights and knowledge. High-ranking members of the Avowed make use of this chamber, but few seekers know of it.

Any creature that has an [[Intelligence]] of 8 or higher that spends 1 hour meditating in the chamber gains the ability to cast the *[[contact other plane]]* spell once, allowing the creature to commune with a spirit. The spell doesn't need to be cast right away, nor does it need to be cast in the chamber. If the spell is not cast within 24 hours, however, it is lost.
