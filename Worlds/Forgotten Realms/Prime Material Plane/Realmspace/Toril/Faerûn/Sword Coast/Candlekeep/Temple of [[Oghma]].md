#### Temple of [[Oghma]]

This modest stone temple is dedicated to the god of knowledge. Its bronze bell announces the beginning of services. Four large stone gargoyles perch on the cornices and gaze down protectively; these seemingly inert statues are **stone golems** charged with defending the temple. If called to service, they glide gently to the ground using a programmed effect similar to a *[[feather fall]]* spell.

The caretaker of the temple in 1492 DR is a [[human]] **[[Priest]]** of Shou descent named Lorekeeper Kei Tigersteel. Though not officially an Avowed, the Lorekeeper enjoys the privilege of entering the library unaccompanied.
