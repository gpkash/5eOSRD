#### Smithy and Stables

A gold [[dwarf]] **veteran** named [[Khe'ril Hammerbind]] oversees the smithy, which adjoins the stables. Khe'ril and his apprentices produce shoes for horses and other mounts here. The heat from the forge provides warmth when winter comes calling.

The stables accommodate a wide range of mounts. Most of the stalls are designed for horses and ponies, but specialized stalls offer secure lodging and care for hippogriffs, griffons, and wyverns as well.

	- "Ach, let me tell ye the sae story o' this blade, laddie. A traveler frae the deserts o' th' far east, it was. The love o' his life, she caught the Scourge, aye and passed in his arms she did. He made a desperate wish for his beloved tae return frae th' land o' th' dead, an' so she did, aye â€“ she rose right out o' the grave, lookin' monstrous an' screamin' like a banshee. Without a moment's hesitation, he struck her doon right then an' there. The puir lass, heart broken intae pieces,  threw emself intae th' ocean, never tae set foot upon this earth again. Fortunately for me dear father, an' for the likes o' yersel', I ken a few folks who can swim, if ye catch me drift, laddie."
