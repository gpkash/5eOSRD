#### Great Readers

Candlekeep maintains a council of eight Great Readers, senior Avowed who oversee day-to-day operations. These erudite scholars and gifted spellcasters are chosen from the ranks of Master Readers. Each is acknowledged as Candlekeep's foremost expert on a particular area of study. Many of them use the **master [[Sage]]** stat block presented earlier in this section.
