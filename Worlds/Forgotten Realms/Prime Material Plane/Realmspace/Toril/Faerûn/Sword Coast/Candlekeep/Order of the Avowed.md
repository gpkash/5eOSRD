# Order of the Avowed

The Avowed are a group of non-denominational, cloistered [[Monk|Monks]] who tended to and protected the great library-fortress of [[Candlekeep]]. They came from all walks of life; from [[Cleric|Clerics]] of the deities who personified the search for knowledge to [[Wizard]] and even some warrior-monks. These monks were united in their scholarly pursuits and their duty to preserve the collected knowledge and lore of the Realms, in all its forms.

### Structure

The order of monks was structured into a fairly regimented hierarchy:  

- The [[Keeper of Tomes]] was the ultimate executive authority within Candlekeep. Their word was law; every declaration was written down for posterity, to be followed by Keepers in the years to come.
- A [[First Reader]] took on the responsibility of maintaining the scholarly integrity of the keep, along with expanding its resources and accumulated knowledge.
- Eight [[Great Readers]] composed the council that oversaw all the activities of Candlekeep and its library.
- The [[Master Readers]] were the dedicated sages and elder monks who oversaw the work of the scribes and trained the acolytes in their continuing education.
- Scribes were responsible for maintaining the archives of Candlekeep. They wrote compilations for those who sought information within the library.
- Acolytes performed general labor, cleaning duties, and other regular chores that were required in such a large keep. They wore black robes.
