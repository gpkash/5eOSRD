# Thalantyr

**Thalantyr** was a tiefling [[wizard]], specialized in [[School of Conjuration|conjuration]], and a former adventurer who lived in his house called [[High Hedge]], west of [[5eOSRD/Worlds/Forgotten Realms/Prime Material Plane/Realmspace/Toril/Faerûn/Sword Coast/Beregost/Beregost]].

## Personality

Later retired, Thalantyr was more at home helping others through magic or advice for a fee. He appeared to never want to see his old adventuring partners again and enjoyed a quiet life. Most of the time, the wizard was happy walking outside alone, not welcoming visitors, nor accepting apprentices.

## Possessions

The noble archmage owned a long dark [[Staff of Power]] and took it on all his trips, whether it was to the town of Beregost or to a distant [[plane]].

## History

Long ago, Thalantyr was a treasure hunter who quested for the lost magic of Netheril in desolate fortresses and keeps. On one such journey, the wizard appeared to have been captured by a horrid beast and only escaped through his quick thinking and the forgotten spells of Netheril.
