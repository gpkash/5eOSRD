## Activities

He led the church's clergy, as well as its sponsored militia of some 200 citizens, in defense of the town.

As governor, Kelddath was a champion to the local farmers, supporting their best interests, as well as those of local entrepreneurs. He was vigilant in his defense of the town and was vehemently against adventurers delving into the [[Ulcaster School of Wizardry|ruins of the local wizard school]]. He and his guards kept the town safe, so that trade and business could flourish. Kelddath Ormlyr oversaw Beregost alongside a town council but was the reigning authority in the town.

## Relationships

Kelddath had several influential allies within the town, having been long-supported by the local conjurer of [[High Hedge]], [[Thalantyr]], as well as the town's blacksmith, [[Taerom Fuiruim|Taerom "Thunderhammer" Fuiruim]]. He also counted the Craumerdaun mercantile family of Amn as allies, having convinced them to establish an estate outside of town and breed their prized horses within its stables.

## History

Before becoming a priest within the [church of Lathander](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Church_of_Lathander "Church of Lathander"), Kelddath was a merchant whose ships sailed along the [[Sword Coast]].

In the [Year of the Banner, 1368 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1368_DR "1368 DR"), in an effort to keep the town of Beregost safe, Kelddath posted a 5,000 gp bounty for the death of the crazed, [[Cyric|Cyricist]] priest Basillus, by proof of his [[5eOSRD/Equipment/Adventuring Gear/Holy Symbol]]. He also offered 2,000 gp for the head of any slain [[Wyvern]].
