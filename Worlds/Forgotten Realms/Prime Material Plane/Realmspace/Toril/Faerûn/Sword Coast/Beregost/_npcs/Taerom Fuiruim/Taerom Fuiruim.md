# Taerom Fuiruim

**Taerom "Thunderhammer" Fuiruim** is a renowned master armorer and weaponsmith, as well as the owner of [[Thunderhammer Smithy]] in [[Beregost]] during the mid−14th century DR. He was very well-respected in his town and considered one of the finest smiths in the entirety of the [[Sword Coast]].

## Description

Taerom was massive in stature, standing over 7 ft (2.1 m) tall and measuring nearly 4 ft (1.2 m) wide at the shoulders. He had brown hair, streaked with gray that extended down into big muttonchop sideburns. He was something of a gentle giant, expressing himself with soft words in contrast to his imposing presence.

## Activities

Taerom Fuiruim had extensive knowledge of the use of rare and exotic ores in metal-crafting, along with other materials. He was even capable of crafting a suit of [[plate mail]] out of the chitinous shell of [[ankhegs]].

## Possessions

In battle, he wielded a massive iron staff, with which he could reportedly slay an orc one deft strike.

## Relationships

The master blacksmith employed over a dozen apprentices at his smithy, including [Surrey](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Surrey "Surrey"), who left his position to seek better work during the iron crisis.

He often worked in concert with the wizard [[Thalantyr]], forging items that were well-suited for magical enchantment by the eccentric mage.
