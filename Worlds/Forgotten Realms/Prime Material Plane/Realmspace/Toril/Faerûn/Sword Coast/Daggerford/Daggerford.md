**Daggerford** was a small but consequential town located in the **_Delimbiyr Vale_** within the greater Sword Coast. While it was primarily a farming community, and considered by some to be a stopover town, the town had great ambitions to grow and be seen as an alternative to their northern neighbor of **Waterdeep**. 

Throughout its storied history, Daggerford's dukes claimed the lands from as far away as Floshin Estates to the north and Dragonspear Castle. In truth, the duchy comprised the town proper and the surrounding farmsteads that numbered around a score or more. Despite its modest size and somewhat inflated sense of importance, Daggerford was resilient. It was something of a relic from the old kingdom of Delimbiyr, too stubborn to fall even when a series of wars, crusades, and other conflicts threatened the entirety of the Sword Coast. 

Daggerford's coat-of-arms was a silver dagger, covered in blood atop a field of dark blue. It was a walled settlement with a population that by and large lived in the outlying hamlets, farms, and estates, rather than within the town proper. As such, the streets of Daggerford were not densely populated. The town was significantly refurbished during the 13th century when many of its 40-odd wooden structures were remade in stone by the dwarves of Clan Ironeater. Even after this improvement, Daggerford's roads were unpaved and several of its buildings were ramshackle in appearance even a century later. Surrounding the town's walls was a modest moat, with three crossing points at each of the town's three gates — the Farmer's Gate in the north, the Caravan Gate in the west, and the River Gate in the south. For many years the moat was a dumping place for the town's refuse. Thankfully, this unfortunate and long-standing tradition was ceased in the late 15th century. Sitting atop a hill in the center of Daggerford was the grand Ducal Castle, which was technically older than the town itself.
