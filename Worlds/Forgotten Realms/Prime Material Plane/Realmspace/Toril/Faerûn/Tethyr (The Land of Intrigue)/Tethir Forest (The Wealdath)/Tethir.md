# The Forest of Tethir

**The Forest of Tethir**, also known as **Wealdath**,[3][5] was the largest forest in the [Lands of Intrigue](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lands_of_Intrigue "Lands of Intrigue")[11] and on the [Sword Coast](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Coast "Sword Coast")[3] and one of the largest in all of [Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn "Faerûn").[11] Some scholars were of the opinion that the forest was the "single most important thing" that set the culture of [Tethyr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tethyr "Tethyr").[2]

## Etymology

The forest was named after the epic [elven](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elf "Elf") hero [Tethir](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tethir_(hero) "Tethir (hero)"),[3] the first elven dragonslayer.[12] The name of the forest is always spelled with an "i", while the name of the country is spelled with a "y",[11] the [Dwarvish](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarvish "Dwarvish") spelling.[13]

The elves also called the forest "Wealdath", which means "unspoiled woods" in [Elvish](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elven_language "Elven language").[3]

After [1370 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1370_DR "1370 DR"), the official name of the forest was made Wealdath by the government of Tethyr, though the people of [Amn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Amn "Amn") still called it the Forest of Tethir.[3]

## Geography

The forest was located in northwest Tethyr, just to the north of the [Starspire Mountains](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Starspire_Mountains "Starspire Mountains").[3] It extended all the way to the tip of the [Dragon's Neck Peninsula](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon%27s_Neck_Peninsula "Dragon's Neck Peninsula"),[11] and was considered at some points in history to be the southern border of Amn.[14]

The forest was full of small lakes, pools, streams, and cascades.[11] The forest was dark and cool,[2] and it received a lot of rain, especially on the Peninsula.[15][2]

The terrain on the Peninsula was rather rocky, unlike the rest of the forest.[2]

The [Trade Way](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Trade_Way "Trade Way") passed through the forest in the west, close to the coast.[15]

### Flora & Fauna

A large yet not particularly dense wood—unless one was at least ten miles from the borders where the trees grew far thicker[2]—the trees of Tethir were very large and old, their wide trunks rising to a great height above.[3] Many of the trees along the [Trade Way](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Trade_Way "Trade Way") were transplanted there after the fall of [Myth Drannor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Myth_Drannor "Myth Drannor")by the elven refugees of [Cormanthor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cormanthor "Cormanthor").[3] Most of the trees were evergreens, though there were many other kinds as well,[11] including cedar, [duskwood](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Duskwood_(tree) "Duskwood (tree)"), maple, and oak.[3]

Smaller plants, such as berry bushes, ivy, and flowering plants also thrived here, and the streams and ponds were full of lilies.[3]

The Forest of Tethir was full of a plethora of monsters—[ankhegs](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ankheg "Ankheg"), [basilisks](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Basilisk "Basilisk"), [bloodthorns](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bloodthorn "Bloodthorn"), [bulettes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bulette "Bulette"), [choke creepers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Choke_creeper "Choke creeper"), [giant spiders](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_spider "Giant spider"), [manticores](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Manticore "Manticore"), [owlbears](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Owlbear "Owlbear"), [stirges](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Stirge "Stirge"), and [wyverns](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wyvern "Wyvern").[6][3][5] Packs of [wolves](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wolf "Wolf") were also common,[6][3] and the trees were home to an abundant variety of birds and wild game.[11] On the Peninsula, the moist conditions meant that there were many fungi, molds, and slimes to be found.[2]

## Government

Officially, with the start of Queen [Zaranda](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zaranda_Star "Zaranda Star")'s reign, the forest was divided into two [duchies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Duchy "wikipedia:en:Duchy"), [Noromath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Noromath "Noromath") in the west and [Durmista](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Durmista "Durmista") in the east, as a major part of the [Principality of the Corsairs' Sea](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Corsairs%27_Sea "Corsairs' Sea").[4] Duke Allain "Foxfire" Kevanarial was the official ruler of Normath,[8] while [Mirthal Aendryr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mirthal_Aendryr "Mirthal Aendryr") officially led Durmista.[9]

## Religion

Worship of both [Eldath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Eldath "Eldath") and [Silvanus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Silvanus "Silvanus") was very popular among those living near and within the borders of the forest, even among the elves.[11][16]

## Notable Locations

[Brost](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Brost "Brost")

This small trading post was on the northern edge of the forest and connected to the [Tethir Road](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tethir_Road "Tethir Road") by a small trail.[17]

The Eight's Tree

This was the secret stronghold of the [Company of Eight](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Company_of_Eight "Company of Eight").[9]

[Mosstone](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mosstone "Mosstone")

This town was located along the [Trade Way](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Trade_Way "Trade Way") just south of the forest.[18]

[Myth Rhynn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Myth_Rhynn "Myth Rhynn")

This ancient elven necropolis lay in the forest. Around [1374 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1374_DR "1374 DR"), the [Vel'Nikeryma](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Vel%27Nikeryma "Vel'Nikeryma") had an interest in restoring its [mythal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mythal "Mythal").[19]

[Suldanessellar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Suldanessellar "Suldanessellar")

This elven city was built high above the ground in the trees.[20]

## Inhabitants

The elves of the Wealdath were divided into two major tribes—the [Elmanesse](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elmanesse "Elmanesse")and the [Suldusk](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Suldusk "Suldusk").[3][5] The Elmanesse lived in a large expanse of woods east of the Trade Way, in Noromath[8]; the Suldusk lived in the southeastern reaches.[2]

[Lythari](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lythari "Lythari"), elven shapeshifters, had at least four [portals](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Portal "Portal") in the forest that led to their plane, a peaceful subdimension.[21][5]

In [1479 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1479_DR "1479 DR"), two cells of the [Eldreth Veluuthra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Eldreth_Veluuthra "Eldreth Veluuthra") operated in the forest, one for each of the Elmanesse and Suldusk elven tribes. The cells aimed to protect their tribal lands from [humans](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Human "Human").[19] Both tribes were closely allied with Tethyr due to the royal family's agreement to respect the elven forest.[10]

Good-aligned [drow](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Drow "Drow") were also reported to live in the Forest of Tethir.[22]

Apart from elves, there were many [fey](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fey "Fey") creatures and monster races making their homes among the trees, among them: [brownies](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Brownie "Brownie"), [centaurs](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Centaur "Centaur"), [dryads](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dryad "Dryad"), [satyrs](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Satyr "Satyr"), [sprites](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sprite "Sprite"), [bugbears](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bugbear "Bugbear"), [gnolls](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gnoll "Gnoll"), [hobgoblins](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hobgoblin "Hobgoblin"), [kobolds](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kobold "Kobold"), [leprechauns](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Leprechaun "Leprechaun"), [lycanthropes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lycanthropy "Lycanthropy"), [ogres](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ogre "Ogre"), [orcs](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orc "Orc"), [treants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Treant "Treant"), [trolls](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Troll "Troll"), [atomies](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Atomie "Atomie"), [green hags](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Green_hag "Green hag"), and [norkers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Norker "Norker").[6][3][5]

Bandits maintained several bases within the borders of the forest, adding to the danger already present from the high population of monsters.[6] Pirates from the [Nelanther Isles](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Nelanther_Isles "Nelanther Isles") would often land on the Peninsula to cut down timber for their ships.[11]

The forest was also used as a base for the Company of Eight, the famous adventuring group, during the [Tethyrian Interregnum](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tethyrian_Interregnum "Tethyrian Interregnum").[23]

The forest was also home to several dragons—at least two [green dragons](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Green_dragon "Green dragon")(Linussaxannol and [Buchembrallor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Buchembrallor "Buchembrallor")[21]) and a [gold](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gold_dragon "Gold dragon") and a [bronze](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bronze_dragon "Bronze dragon") ([Garlokantha](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Garlokantha "Garlokantha") and [Arellaxerrontoal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arellaxerrontoal "Arellaxerrontoal")[21]).[5] [White dragons](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/White_dragon "White dragon") used to live in the forest, but by 1370 DR, these lairs were occupied by [goblinoid](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Goblinoid "Goblinoid") tribes.[21]

## History

The Forest of Tethir was once a part of a single massive forest covering the modern Lands of Intrigue. The elves named this forest kingdom [Keltormir](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Keltormir "Keltormir"). Wars with [dragons](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon "Dragon") and [giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giant "Giant") led to the destruction of great swaths of forest and split Keltomir into the [Snakewood](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Snakewood "Snakewood"), [Shilmista](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shilmista "Shilmista"), the [Forest of Mir](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Forest_of_Mir "Forest of Mir"), and the Forest of Tethir. This was known as the First Tethirift. The war was ended when the great hero Tethir sacrificed his own life and killed two great [red dragons](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Red_dragon "Red dragon").[12]

The forest was originally home to the Suldusk, Tethir, and Stilmyst clans.[24]

Enmity between the humans of Tethyr and the elves of Tethir rose about 85 years before the [Dalereckoning](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR"), when the humans from Clan Karlag began foresting parts of the forest to create beaches for their shipyards. While he was trying to negotiate peace between the elves and the human clans, one of the Karlag clansmen murdered the crown prince of Tethyr, Garynor Ithal II. Clan Karlag was outcast forevermore. The clear-cut region of the forest later became the path the Trade Way would take.[25]

In the tenth century [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR"), forest fires burned down many of the trees of the central forest, but this ended up creating peaceful groves and opportunities for younger trees to flourish.[3]

In the [Year of the Wave, 1364 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1364_DR "1364 DR"), a mercenary named Bunlap ran a logging operation in the eastern part of the forest, and his men killed and enslaved many elves. Bunlap was stopped by the efforts of [Arilyn Moonblade](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arilyn_Moonblade "Arilyn Moonblade"), who had been sent from [Evermeet](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Evermeet "Evermeet"). The incident was known as the Tethir Conflicts.[26]

Before the Tethyrian civil war, [demihumans](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Demihuman "Demihuman") were treated poorly by the humans of Tethyr, and they had no rights. The elves, especially, were driven deep into the forest.[6] This was triggered by the accidental death of [Errilam I](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Errilam_I "Errilam I") in [1277 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1277_DR "1277 DR"),[27]which was blamed on the elves.[3] (Indeed, elves were responsible, as the death had been the work of the [Eldreth Veluuthra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Eldreth_Veluuthra "Eldreth Veluuthra").[28]) When the [Lions' Dynasty](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lions%27_Dynasty "Lions' Dynasty") was overthrown and the Interregnum began, the elves formed their own Elven Council and considered the Forest of Tethir its own sovereign nation.[29]

After the Interregnum, Queen Zaranda made peace with the elves of the forest and sought to integrate them into politics.[3]

## Rumors and Legends

The Forest of Tethir was feared by humans for generations, ever since the death of King Errilam.[3]

In [1357 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1357_DR "1357 DR"), there was talk about a powerful [archdevil](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Archdevil "Archdevil") gathering evil forces to himself in the midst of the forest.[6]
