The Zhentarim, (pronounced: zz-HENT-ah-rim) previously known as the Black Network,was a mercenary company, and greater mercantile organization in Faerûn, who, over their 200 years of existence, has had a storied history as a cadre of self-serving thieves, spies, assassins and malevolent wizards, who for a time, were indentured by their leaders to serve dark gods [[5eOSRD/Worlds/Deities/Bane|Bane]] and [[Cyric]]. Over the decades, the organization experienced several leaps and bounds in terms of successes, but also major misfortune, particularly for their historical strongholds around the Moonsea. As of 1489 DR the Zhentarim was headquartered in the Western Heartlands, at Darkhold Castle, nestled in the valley of the same name.

> *As distasteful as Hillsfar's policies might be, you can hardly expect us to deal with the baby-slaying Keepers. I've heard that they plight their troth with succubi, eat the brains of elves, and worship gods so black they make Moander seem nice. Their names are feared as far south as my native land. And the council who rules them, the Zhentarim, are twice as dark as the Keepers.*

## Aims and goals
As an extension of the will of the dark wizard Manshoon, the Zhentarim was initially formed as a mercenary company to support his rule over the Moonsea with the aim of spreading that control over all of Faerûn. After he recruited the faithful of Bane, unscrupulous merchants and lesser mages to his cause, they collectively sought to dominate all aspects of the Realms, either by manipulation, outright control or, if they couldn't exert control over something, extinction.

After the mass purge of the Cyricists, known as the Banedeath, and the subsequent partial destruction of Zhentil Keep following the Cyrinishad debacle, the power of the Zhentarim passed to the Bane-worshiping Fzoul Chembryl. He made secret deals with leaders in the Moonsea to erect temples to Iyachtu Xvim, Bane's divine son, within the capitals of their city-states. His aim to extend the will of the Lord of Tyrants across Toril was a dynamic factor behind many of the changes within the organization. He sought to use the Black Network to set the stage for the return of the Lord of Tyrants.

By the late 15th century the goals of the Zhentarim came in line with their original ideals, despite their more benign public perception. By offering the best guards and mercenaries, with the final aim of an iron-fisted monopoly on protection services in the Realms, they sought to make the merchants of Faerûn, and thus the continental economy, completely reliant upon them as an organization. While many of their practices and services they offered were completely legal, they were not above spending a tremendous amount of gold to destroy their competitors and secure future profits to increase their wealth, influence and power.

## Activities

In order to achieve their financial goals the Zhentarim agents often dealt in illicit goods and contraband, using their extensive mercantile contacts to move products throughout the Moonsea, neighboring lands and over Faerûn's more hazardous terrains. The types of commodities they dealt in were slaves, poison], drugs and even smokepowder weapons.

As a means of eliminating their competition, the Zhentarim used the Zhentilar army of Zhentil Keep or recruited bands of monstrous humanoids to take down rival caravans, often completing the route under their own banner to earn good faith and new business with merchant groups. They were not above resorting to sabotage, blackmail, arson to outright murder to undermine their mercantile or political opponents. They were even known to purposefully upset the balance of natural beasts, stir up aggressive monster populations within the wild, and even have their mages summon foul monstrosities to threaten isolated towns and villages, in effect forcing the residents to rely upon the protection of the Zhentilar.

## Organization

### Inner Circle
From the early years of the organization until 1369 DR, a few years prior the resurrection of Bane, the Zhentarim's was ruled by the triumvirate of Manshoon, the ultimate authority and Lord of Zhentil Keep, Sememmon, his arcane student who presided over Darkhold, and Fzoul Chembryl, the High Priest of Bane. The Zhentarim was rife with mistrust, even amongst its upper echelons. While Manshoon had a bond of trust with his pupil Sememmon, his relationship with Fzoul was one of mutual disdain shrouded by public respect. While the three shared the same goal of increasing their collective wealth and power, it was at best an uneasy alliance that ultimately fell apart.

- ***Manshoon:*** In addition to his role as the ultimate authority of the Zhentarim, Manshoon held the title of High Lord of Zhentil keep, speaker of the city-state's Council of Lords and had the full backing of the Zhentilar army. He kept close control over the Moonsea Zhentarim, and controlled the other city states such as Hillsfar, the Citadel of the Raven and even Mulmaster, either through manipulation of their leadership or outright force. Prior to the partial destruction of Zhentil Keep, Manshoon moved his operations over to the Citadel, avoiding the chaos brought on by the Cyricists following the Banedeath.
- ***Sememmon:*** The obedient and skillful lieutenant of Manshoon long served as the Lord of Darkhold and unfailingly loyal servant of the Zhentarim. Due to its distance from Manshoon and the Moonsea Zhentarim, the mage-lord only recruited the most loyal and capable agents, about 1000 strong, to the dark keep hidden within the Far Hills. Sememmon's second-in-command was the powerful mage Ashemmi, a former Harper, his consort and true love.
- ***Fzoul Chembryl:*** Before he became the exarch of Bane following the Spellplague, the faithful servant Fzoul served as the Dark God's chosen, and the High Priest of his clergy at the Black Altar in Zhentil Keep.

### The Moonsea
***Council of Lords:*** While many councilors of Zhentil Keep chose positions of subservience or acquiescence to the Zhentarim. A few of the Keep's Lords were active and proud members of the Zhentarim.
- Lord Orgauth:
- Lady Desmonda:
- Lady Alicia: The first Lady to sit on the council of Lords showed much promise in the eyes of Manshoon.
- Lord Halaster:
- Lord Phandymm: This secret worshiper of Bane openly supported - Fzoul Chembryl prior to his ascendancy as leader of the Zhentarim and promoted worship of the Black Lord within the Keep.
- 
#### Church of Bane/Xvim
Working under Fzoul Chembryl, a number of Zhentarim agents came into the organization from the church of Bane. During the years following the Time of Troubles, when Cyricists came into power within Zhentil Keep, many former Banites converted to Xvimism.
- Ruinlord Casildar: Acting as a second to both Tor Blackflame and Xana the Once-Martyred, the half-elven priest commanded significant power in his coordination with Zhentarim caravan leaders.
- Ruinlord Asdag: The cruel priest of Bane served as the de facto ruler of Teshwave, before becoming the head of internal security and head torturer of Zhentil Keep.

#### Church of Cyric
Following his ascension during the Time of Troubles, Cyric's followers gained prominence within the Zhentarim. Many of the organizations Banites converted to Cyricism and often had conflicts with those who chose to worship Iyachtu Xvim, Bane's divine son.

#### Caravan masters
Meer, the Head of Caravans for the Zhentarim was overseen by the dark mage Sarthor. He worked with Aghebar who directed individual Zhentarim merchants and Maglor the apothecary. They were served by several caravan masters: Ultan Rathelstan, Krommiar Kethyr, Neth Ilturin, Lhemako Taraskh and (after 1369 DR) Samras Quolcon and Tamek Ilturin.

#### Diplomats
- Miraun: This charming mage served as the "voice" of the Zhentarim, when they were required to parlay and negotiate with foreign heads-of-state.

#### Military
While not all the members of the Zhentilar or other armies of the Moonsea were members of the Zhentarim, many agents had been installed within their ranks.

- Lord General Ulgrym: Having proven himself as captain of the Zhentilar under Guthbert Golthammer in Teshwave, Ulgrym eventually became the Captain of Security within Zhentil Keep, and after joining the Zhentarim,Commander of the Zhentilar.
- Vrakk:
- Kandar Milinal: A strict leader and loyal officer, Kandar commanded the Ravenar the military arm of the Citadel of the Raven.

- Eregul: An ally of Manshoon prior to joining the Zhentarim, Eregul sought to supplant Thagdal and earn a seat in Zhentil Keep's Council of Lords.

#### Auxiliary forces
While not official members of the Zhentarim, their wide-reaching influence gave them access to political powers, military units and groups of skilled individuals.
- Naug-adar: This cabal of lesser wizards, also known as the "devil dogs", were only granted admittance into the Zhentarim if they demonstrated significant initiative in their duties.
- Naug-orls: The thieves' guild of Zhentil Keep acted as scouts and reconnaissance agents for the Zhentarim within the Moonsea region. They were led by the master assassin known as Night Fingers.
- Zhentilar: The High Lord of Zhentil Keep possessed the power of city-state's military, the Zhentilar. During the reign of Manshoon he was served by several commanders including, Battlelord Syal Amandon, and later General Ulgrym, former captain of security within the Keep.

### The West
Lord Taradril Aumraven led the political and mercantile endeavors under the Lord of Darkhold. The elder wizard believed Sememmon to be a far better leader than Manshoon, as he actually regarded the well being of the citizens of his realm when making decisions.

#### Assassins
Sememmon was served by group of stealthy killers known as The Three: Mairhe, Sahbonn and Itlur.

#### Church of Cyric
- Watchful Skull Dhamir Ercals: The High Priest of Cyric, who led the Second Banedeath in Darkhold, was granted significant power by Lord Sememmon.
