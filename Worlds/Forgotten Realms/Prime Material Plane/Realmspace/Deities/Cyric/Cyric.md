# Cyric

**Cyric** *(pronounced:  _SEER-ik)*, known as **Sirhivatizangpo** by his [Gugari](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gugari "Gugari") worshipers[4] and as **N'asr** by the [Bedine](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bedine "Bedine"),[30][31] was the monomaniacal [Faerunian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBnian_pantheon "Faerûnian pantheon") [god](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/God "God") of lies, trickery,[32] and strife,[32] having previously held dominion over tyranny, murder, lies, intrigue, and illusion.[5][21] It was the unholy radiance of the **Dark Sun** that drew power-hungry mortals to their inexorable deaths like moths to a flame,[21] and it was the **Prince of Lies** who murdered [Mystra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mystra "Mystra") and caused the [Spellplague](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spellplague "Spellplague"), throwing the cosmos into turmoil in an act that cost him much of his following.[11]

> *“If I can destroy the love of gods, then I can certainly fill the lives of Faerûn's mortals with strife and discord.”*
— Cyric, during his trial.[33]

## Description

As a mortal man, Cyric had a lean athletic build. His dark brown hair outlined a face of sharp angles, highlighted by crow's-feet eyes,[13] a pointed chin, and hawkish nose.[34]

On first becoming a god, Cyric's [avatar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar "Avatar") took on a similar appearance, but with ghastly pale skin and intense, dark eyes.[21][5][35] He exhibited human mannerisms, and was often prone to wriggling and squirming when he became anxious or impatient,[36][37][38] But after a decade of godhood, Cyric's avatar began to more reflect the horrific nature of his character. His face went so gaunt it resembled a skull and the skin wrapped around his tightly wound cords of muscle turned red.[35] Cyric's eyes appeared as small flames within his skull, his teeth turned crooked and yellowed,[39] and his fingers were stripped of flesh until only bone remained.[40] With some effort, Cyric could hide this appearance with use of [illusion](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Illusion "Illusion") magic when making appearances in the Realms.[41]

Following his descent into madness, Cyric's skeletal visage[42] and bony hands were scarred and scorched by the flaming souls of his wretched faithful. Unlike before, these wounds could not be hidden by any form of magical means.[43]Cyric's fractured psyche caused him to speak in a thousand voices at once.[42]What remained of his heart appeared as a mass of [poisonous](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Poison "Poison") brown sludge interwoven with white cords, which were in fact remnants of the two gods he had slain.[44]

## Personality

“

If you lavish godhood on the pretenders that chained you here, then you're right. I'm no god. I'm very much more than that.

”

— Cyric, to [Kezef](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kezef "Kezef") the Chaos Hound.[45]

In life, Cyric was a petty and selfish man that believed everyone was truly alone in life. Placing trust in others was folly that would only end in suffering or, in all likelihood, death.[13] While he occasionally acted in the interest of others[46] and once famously rallied the [Dalesfolk](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dalesfolk "Dalesfolk") in a [terrific battle](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Second_battle_of_Shadowdale "Second battle of Shadowdale"),[47] Cyric was unfortunately overcome by the worst aspects of his nature.[48][49]

Cyric's selfishness, inability to cope with intense feelings,[50] and unwillingness to rely upon others for support,[13] led Cyric to isolate and withdraw himself from people that actually cared for him.[51] As a result, Cyric suffered and languished in a state of inner turmoil. His earnest but malnourished desire to do right by others remained at odds with his sense of self-preservation and a yearning to prove himself by appearing powerful.[52]

Cyric's experiences as an adventurer accentuated the darker aspects of his persona, namely his perverse fascination with killing,[53] the ease with which he spoke half-truths, his inclination to incite fear in others, the urge for bloodlust he harbored, and the pleasure he felt when exerting dominance over the weak.[49]The worst aspects of Cyric's humanity were only magnified when he ascended to divinity. As a god Cyric was entirely egocentric,[29] and took immense joy from manipulating mortals into ruining or ending their own lives.[29][21] For a time Cyric came to believe himself superior to all other beings in the [multiverse](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Multiverse "Multiverse").[5][7]

As the youngest god of the Faerûnian pantheon,[24][54] Cyric's self-absorption led to him often acting out like a child. He was irrationally impatient and became restless[55] and moody[56] when things didn't go his way fast enough for his liking.[57] He formed petty, nasty, and sexist nicknames for the other gods and he insisted that courtiers in his divine court only refer to them as such.[58] In truth, Cyric was terrified of the other powers, and was even put ill at ease by some [demipowers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Demigod "Demigod"),[59] to the point that he became crippled with paranoia.[60][17]

During his descent into madness, Cyric's unpredictability and erratic behavior became much worse.[57] He was overtaken with a myriad of delusions and countless voices in his mind[5] that some speculated were the remnants of the gods he had slain.[26] He would fantasize horrors that could be inflicted upon those that wronged him, conflate those fallacies with half-truths and false memories, then accept the results as new reality that comprised glorious victories over his enemies.[61] Cyric's cracked and chaotic psyche could barely hold back his myriad of conflicting selves.[62][35] Cyric abandoned any precept of a polytheistic pantheon, and came to believe himself the only true god of the Realms,[8] and demanded that all his followers appease and worship him as such.[5][63]

## Abilities

For a time Cyric was among the most powerful deities among the Faerûnian pantheon, having taken on at least partial portfolios of five different deities.[24]He drew much of his own power from the constant in-fighting between the various sects and cells of [his church](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Church_of_Cyric "Church of Cyric").[64]

Cyric's avatar was entirely immune to the effects of illusion, [charm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Charm "Charm"), [fear](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fear "Fear")-inducing, or other emotion-altering magic, and was always ignored by [undead](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Undead "Undead")beings. He could [inflict madness](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Feeblemind "Feeblemind") upon others with his mere touch. He often appeared as an avatar that resembled his mortal body, but could choose any form he wished,[5] at times preferring those of a terrible spider,[65] or the visage of a skull.[66] Cyric's divine powers were amplified while on [Pandemonium](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Pandemonium "Pandemonium"), the plane of pure chaos.[67] For a brief time, Cyric was stripped of any and all magical powers by Mystra, when she refused to grant him access to [the Weave](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Weave "The Weave").[68]

When he appeared as a manifestation, Cyric preferred to take on the appearance of a [wraith](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wraith "Wraith") that haunted the dreams of mortals or that of a poisonous cloud of smoke. When he couldn't be bothered to appear himself, Cyric merely created nightmares of undead in the psyche of his victims.[5]

## Possessions

As an adventurer, Cyric kept an array of weapons and handy magical items. He kept on his person several [daggers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dagger "Dagger"), a [handaxe](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Handaxe "Handaxe"), both [long](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Long_sword "Long sword") and [short swords](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Short_sword "Short sword"), and a [longbow](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Longbow "Longbow") with a [quiver](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Quiver "Quiver") of [arrows](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arrow "Arrow").[13][69] At times he wore a suit of [plate mail](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Plate_mail "Plate mail"),[13]and at others shrouded himself within a dark _[cloak of displacement](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cloak_of_displacement "Cloak of displacement")_.[69]

Cyric's throne room within his [divine realm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Castle "Bone Castle") was a monument to his victories. It housed twisted trophies that besmirched other gods and degraded their followers, including a painting of a [Deneiran](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Deneir "Deneir") faithful, the pigment of which was made of children's blood; the executioner's axe of a crazed king that venerated [Tyr](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tyr "Tyr"); and the nail of a worshiper of [Sune](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sune "Sune") used to blind himself after receiving a vision of the goddess of beauty.[70] He drank from a [ruby](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby "Ruby")-studded [silver](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Silver "Silver") chalice crafted to resemble a cloven heart. It was said to be filled with the tears of jilted lovers and crestfallen idealists,[29][71] and even held those shed by two lovelorn gods.[72]

### Weaponry

In his final months as a mortal,[73] and first decade as a god, Cyric wielded the [sentient](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sentient_item "Sentient item") shortsword _[Godsbane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Godsbane "Godsbane")_. He was completely enamored with the sword,[61]and revered her as his most prized possession and dearest companion.[6] Cyric nourished her with the blood of the powerful and the innocent.[73] _Godsbane_was in fact the transformed sentience of [Mask](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mask "Mask"), the God of Illusions.[5] While in Cyric's possession, Mask cooed into Cyric's ear, fulfilling the role of his lover and enabler of his worst delusions and most twisted schemes.[74]

Following the revelation of Mask's treachery, Cyric acquired a new blade, the _+5 longsword_ called _[Razor's Edge](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Razor%27s_Edge "Razor's Edge")_.[20][75]

## Divine Realms

Following his ascension, Cyric took over the former [divine realm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_realm "Divine realm") of [Myrkul](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Myrkul "Myrkul"), the [Bone Castle](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Castle "Bone Castle"), in the [Gray Waste](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gray_Waste "Gray Waste") (also known as Hades in the [Great Wheel cosmological model](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Wheel_cosmology "Great Wheel cosmology")).[54] When he lost dominion over the dead to Kelemvor, Cyric relocated to Pandemonium and fashioned himself a warped and changeable realm he named the [Castle of the Supreme Throne](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Supreme_Throne "Supreme Throne"), known as the Shattered Castle by others.[5][24][25][76] Within the [World Tree cosmology](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/World_Tree_cosmology "World Tree cosmology"), Cyric took the [batrachi](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Batrachi "Batrachi") realm of the Supreme Throne from [Limbo](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Limbo "Limbo") and fashioned his own plane from it. The Supreme Throne survived the transition as the cosmos reshaped into a [newly accepted model](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/World_Axis_cosmology "World Axis cosmology"), though it became a prison for the Mad God.[77][78]

## Activities

“

Didn't you hear [Ao](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ao "Ao")? There was no crime. Leira died because I willed it. Any of you could be next. That's my place in [the Balance](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Balance "The Balance"): To weed out the weak from this pathetic pantheon.

”

— Cyric, to his fellow greater powers.[79]

As a god Cyric begrudgingly fulfilled his divine duties to a point, but mainly focused on his plots to strike out against those he hated.[74] He carried this neglect so far as to disrupt the Balance of the divine powers, and sow discord among the other members of the pantheon.[8]

## Relationships

“

I have little desire to see yet another godling who might be a possible opponent. If you even have any power worth noting.

”

— Cyric, to [Abdel Adrian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abdel_Adrian "Abdel Adrian") in [1369 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1369_DR "1369 DR").[59]

### With Mortals

While operating in the [thieves' guild](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Naug-orls "Naug-orls") of Zhentil Keep, Cyric was instructed by a ruthless mentor named [Marek](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marek "Marek"). Cyric maintained an acquaintance with the vicious thief [Quicksal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Quicksal "Quicksal"), though they could hardly be called friends.[80] Cyric did find true camaraderie with his fellow adventurer [Midnight](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mystra_(Midnight) "Mystra (Midnight)"),[81] and the pair formed a close bond in short order.[82] Midnight tended to Cyric[83] when he was gravely wounded,[84] and the thief was genuinely grateful.[81] That bond did not last long however, as Midnight's burgeoning romance with their fellow adventurer [Kelemvor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kelemvor "Kelemvor") incited fierce jealousy in Cyric.[85] After Mystra spurned Cyric's romantic interests, he grew increasingly impatient and then hateful towards her,[49] a dynamic that continued following their ascensions to godhood.[21]

### Divine Foes

Cyric looked down upon[58] and even hated most of the other deities of [Toril](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril "Toril"), and held particular loathing for Mystra, Kelemvor, and [Bane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bane "Bane"),[21] whose death he claimed credit for and whose divine portfolio he briefly took over.[86] Cyric's hatred for Mystra and Kelemvor originated during their time together as mortal companions, and intensified after his ascension. Cyric lashed out at everyone and everything the goddess Midnight held dear,[87] and scoured the multiverse to enact revenge Kelemvor's mortal soul[88][89] His loathing for Kelemvor intensified after the hero arose as a god himself, and was given power over a portion of Cyric's domain.[90]

Cyric drew the ire of [Oghma](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Oghma "Oghma") when he manipulated the god's dominion over the spread of knowledge in an attempt to convert all the Realms to the Cyricist faith.[60]

Over time, Cyric became paranoid of the Realms' greater powers, believing they all conspired together to strip him of his divinity,[60] and was ultimately left alone with no allies.[68] Cyric's fear led to making many enemies among the pantheon: [Azuth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Azuth "Azuth"), Tyr, [Torm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Torm "Torm"), Deneir, Leira, [Iyachtu Xvim](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Iyachtu_Xvim "Iyachtu Xvim"), Bane, and many others.[5][21]

### Divine Allies

During his time as Lord of the Dead, Cyric was dutifully served by his seneschal [Jergal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jergal "Jergal"),[91] the god whose former portfolios Cyric later claimed.[92] Jergal attempted to advise Cyric, guide him during his dealings with other deities—especially the [Circle of Twelve Powers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Circle_of_Twelve_Powers "Circle of Twelve Powers")—and help properly govern his divine domain.[74] The former god of the dead was wholly unsuccessful in his efforts.[7][93]

Cyric maintained a partnership with Mask for a time, but believed him a weakling and coward.[94] When Mask revealed himself to be Cyric's sword _Godsbane_,[5]the two became hated enemies.[21] He later forged a similar alliance with Shar[95]—the divine mother of Mask—[96]but was manipulated by the Lady of Night into carrying out plots that benefited her, and burdening the blame afterwards.[78][97]Cyric lashed out at Shar in revenge, but by that time was too ineffectual to harm her or her following.[66]

In his desperate struggle to maintain power, Cyric resorted to cavorting with at least two of the [Seven Lost Gods](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Seven_Lost_Gods "Seven Lost Gods"), [Kezef](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kezef "Kezef") the Chaos Hound and [Dendar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dendar "Dendar") the Night Serpent. These dangerous otherworldly beings were feared by even the greater powers of the Realms.[98][99]

## Worshipers

Even before godhood Cyric attracted a zealous contingent of Zhent warriors called the [Company of the Scorpions](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Company_of_the_Scorpions "Company of the Scorpions") that devoted themselves to his cause. They followed Cyric during his quest to retrieve the _[Tablets of Fate](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tablets_of_Fate "Tablets of Fate")_ and cast aside their loyalties to their former employers and home realms. But while Cyric did spare them from inadvertent death,[100] he only traveled with them so long as they proved useful,[101] and completely abandoned them afterwards.[102][73]

### Church

_Main article: [Church of Cyric](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Church_of_Cyric "Church of Cyric")_

The Cyricist church was hated across Toril with good reason: Cyric's church was pledged to spread strife and work murder everywhere in order to make folk believe in and fear the Dark Sun. It supported cruel rulers and indulged fostered fear and intrigue while avoiding the spread of outright war. The church was often beset by internal feuds and backstabbing for some time before eventually waning.[21][103] Many outside the church viewed it as a twisted den of madness, trickery, and death. Cyricist clergy condemned this outlook, preferring to see their religion as one of enlightenment. It purportedly revealed that all societal bonds of friendship, family, and love were nothing but ties that always withered away, and were therefore useless, weak, and pitiful.[32]

Cyric's [clerics](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Clerics "Clerics") prayed for spells at night, after moonrise, and often trained as [rogues](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rogues "Rogues") or [assassins](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Assassins "Assassins").[21] His [specialty priests](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Specialty_priest "Specialty priest") were known as [strifeleaders](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Strifeleader "Strifeleader").[104]They celebrated few holy days and did not acknowledge the date of his ascension to divinity, because it coincide with that of Midnight. Whenever a temple acquired something, or someone, important enough to be sacrificed, its high priest declared a Day of the Dark Sun to signify the holiness of the event. Eclipses were considered holy occasions, and were accompanied by feasts, fervent prayers, and bloody sacrifices.[21]

In addition to the worshipers Cyric claimed during his ascension, he also garnered those of the Leiran faith after slaying the Lady of Deception.[105]Cyric's faith spread across some unlikely groups, including the insular Bedine people of [Anauroch](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Anauroch "Anauroch"),[106] [Tethyrian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tethyr "Tethyr") cultists of Ao that remained unaware of their true divine patron,[107] some of the more malevolent [tieflings](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tiefling "Tiefling") of the Realms,[108]and renegade [githyanki](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki "Githyanki") that forewent worship of their [lich](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lich "Lich")-queen.[109]

### Center of Worship

In the early years of Cyric's divinity, [Zhentil Keep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zhentil_Keep "Zhentil Keep")[110] and the surrounding lands of the [Moonsea](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moonsea "Moonsea") were considered the center of his worship in the Realms.[111][112]During this time the [Zhentarim](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zhentarim "Zhentarim") served as an extension of the Cyricist church.[113][114] Following the decline of Cyric's influence, his religion endured throughout [Amn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Amn "Amn") and the [Lands of Intrigue](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lands_of_Intrigue "Lands of Intrigue").[115][116] The tenets of Cyricism fit in well with their culture of ambition, lack of reliance on others, and "buyer beware"–type contracts.[32]

### Deceased

Cyric's immortal servants were known as the 'denizens'[117] or 'shades', souls that dwelled within the Bone Castle and the surrounding [City of Strife](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/City_of_the_Dead_(Hades) "City of the Dead (Hades)"). He also held dominion over [the False](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_False "The False")—souls of the dead that lied about the god they worshiped—and the [Faithless](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faithless "Faithless"), whose tortured forms composed [the Wall](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Wall_of_the_Faithless "Wall of the Faithless").[118]Cyric considered his denizens to be servile minions whose only purpose was to appropriately fear their god and cater to his needs.[119] Cyric had their immortal forms changed to grotesque and powerful monstrosities that better suited his liking.[120] He offered protection from his terrible plots in exchange for their eternal service, but only upheld his end of the bargain when convenient.[71]

### Notable Worshipers

- [Elisande](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elisande "Elisande"), one of Cyric's Chosen that played an influential role in the Moonsea when the [demon lords](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_lord "Demon lord") entered into the [Underdark](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Underdark "Underdark").[121]
- [Malchior](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Malchior "Malchior"), the greedy and cunning Cyricist that dwelled in the fortress of [Darkhold](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Darkhold "Darkhold").[122]
- [Malik el Sami](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Malik_el_Sami "Malik el Sami"), another of Cyric's Chosen and often-favored agent to carry out his will.[66] As a boon, Cyric tore Malik's heart out of his chest and replaced it with his own.[44]

### Temples

Notable temples to Cyric included:

- [Darkhold](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Darkhold "Darkhold"), the Zhentarim fortress in the [Western Heartlands](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Western_Heartlands "Western Heartlands").[123]
- [House of Cyric](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/House_of_Cyric_(Skullport) "House of Cyric (Skullport)"), the god's subterranean temple beneath [Skullport](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Skullport "Skullport").[124]
- [Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Twin_Towers_of_the_Eternal_Eclipse "Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse"), the center of Cyricist worship in Amn.[125]

## History

### The Mortal

“

Though men may try to wrest the reins of their destiny from the gods, they are all born at the mercy of Nature, bound in a hundred ways to those around them. This is how the gods insure mortals are tied to their world of toil and sorrow. Cyric of Zhentil Keep was no exception.

”

— Opening lines to _[The True Life of Cyric](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_True_Life_of_Cyric "The True Life of Cyric")_.[126]

The mortal Cyric was born a bastard to two of Zhentil Keep's most unfortunate souls sometime around the early 1330s [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR"). His mother was an unsuccessful and destitute [bard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bard "Bard") that lived in the poorest part of Zhentil Keep, and his father was a low-ranking [Zhentilar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zhentilar "Zhentilar") officer that refused to acknowledge Cyric as his son. Cyric's mother resorted to prostitution and depended on the good will of others to keep her son alive, which she managed until the day she was slain by Cyric's father. The illegitimate Cyric was sold into slavery by his father, as recompense for the inconvenience of his existence, and shipped off to the southern nation of [Sembia](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sembia "Sembia").[13][126]

The infant Cyric was purchased by a childless merchant-class couple as an heir to pass on their wine-making business. Astolpho the vintner and his wife raised Cyric in the lap of luxury for years, catering to the young lad's every want and desire. At the age of ten, _circa_ the [Year of the Lion, 1340 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1340_DR "1340 DR"), Cyric uncovered the truth of his birth and dramatically ran away from his family's estate. While he was promptly returned home by local guardsmen, Cyric boisterously asserted to all that his true home was Zhentil Keep and word of his origins spread rapidly among the Sembian elite. Over the course of the next two years, Cyric's parents became pariahs among their peers and their businesses came to ruin. The young man's growing mistrust of his parents turned to derision and outright hatred of them. At the mere age of 12 years old, Cyric murdered his parents in their sleep and left Sembia, heading north for Zhentil Keep.[13][126]

Believing the death of his parents would grant him peace, Cyric set out to make a life of his own. But the reality of surviving in the Realms quickly set in with Cyric. Within a [tenday](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tenday "Tenday") he found himself near-starving and stricken with fever at the border of the [Dalelands](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dalelands "Dalelands"). In a stroke of twisted fate, the dying child was captured by Zhent slavers and taken north to Zhentil Keep in the Moonsea.[13] He eventually escaped from bondage, lived on the streets for a time, and eventually joined the local thieves' guild.[127]

### The Adventurer

_Circa_ the [Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1350_DR "1350 DR"),[128][note 2] Cyric attempted to steal the _[Ring of Winter](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ring_of_Winter_(artifact) "Ring of Winter (artifact)")_ from a powerful tribe of [frost giants](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Frost_giant "Frost giant") led by Thrym, but was unsuccessful and became trapped in their cave. The opportunity to flee only came when a band of adventurers, including the mercenary [Kelemvor Lyonsbane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kelemvor_Lyonsbane "Kelemvor Lyonsbane"), attacked the frost giants' lair while also trying to find the _Ring of Winter_. Kelemvor's entire party, save himself, was slain and only he and Cyric managed to escape.[129] Once back in [Arabel](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arabel "Arabel") the two eventually joined [Adon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Adon "Adon"), a young cleric of Sune, and they took work from the local city watch to uncover a traitor.[46]

During the [Time of Troubles](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Time_of_Troubles "Time of Troubles") in the [Year of Shadows, 1358 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1358_DR "1358 DR"), Cyric went to make offerings to an avatar of [Tymora](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tymora "Tymora") when she appeared in Arabel. Cyric was doubtful about the gods' arrival in the mortal realms and postulated that a divine being would have no use for his [gold](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Currency "Currency").[130] Some time later, Cyric, Kelemvor, and Adon met [Caitlan Moonsong](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Caitlan_Moonsong "Caitlan Moonsong"),[131] a mysterious young girl. Caitlan beseeched the trio to help her on a quest to free the now-mortal Mystra, who had been imprisoned in [Castle Kilgrave](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Castle_Kilgrave "Castle Kilgrave") by the avatar of the god Bane.[132] They were soon joined by Midnight,[133] a charming adventuring [magic-user](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Magic-user "Magic-user") to whom Cyric felt an immediate connection.[82]

The group freed Mystra from the clutches of Bane on [Midsummer](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Midsummer "Midsummer"), and accompanied her to the [Celestial Stairway](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Celestial_Stairway "Celestial Stairway"), where she confronted still-divine [Helm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Helm "Helm"), the God of Guardians. Despite Mystra's insistence that she deliver to Ao the message that Bane and Myrkul had stolen the _Tablets of Fate_, Helm would not let her re-enter the planes. The avatars of the two gods fought a brief but terrible battle, one that excited Cyric's bloodlust like never before, and Helm slew Mystra on the steps of the Stairway.[48]

After passing through [Tilverton](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tilverton "Tilverton"),[134] the group journeyed eastward to seek out [Elminster](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elminster "Elminster") in [Shadowdale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowdale "Shadowdale").[135] While passing through the [Spiderhaunt Wood](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spiderhaunt_Wood "Spiderhaunt Wood") they encountered the [Company of Dawn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Company_of_Dawn "Company of Dawn") adventuring band,[136] and Cyric uncharacteristically became fast friends with a young, naïve thief named [Brion](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Brion "Brion"). Their connection was tragically cut short however, when [giant spiders](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giant_spider "Giant spider") attacked the two adventuring groups and Brion was violently killed before Cyric's eyes.[137] Cyric was clearly traumatized by the experience, but did not speak of it to others.[50]

### The Hero

> *“You wish glory? You wish to lay down your worthless lives? Alright. But will you seek it at the cost of their lives? Leave this place and who will protect them?...Stand with me and you stand with Shadowdale!”*
— Cyric to the Dalesfolk during the [Second battle of Shadowdale](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Second_battle_of_Shadowdale "Second battle of Shadowdale"), [1358 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1358_DR "1358 DR").[47]

The troupe arrived at Shadowdale on the eve of a Zhentilar invasion. Seeing the Dalesman confronted with overwhelming odds, Cyric's old mentor Marek suggested they leave together and defect to the Zhents' cause. Marek claimed they were both born for a life of murder and theft. Cyric refused, insisting that he would fight for his honor among his new friends. Marek forsook his friendship with the younger thief and walked away from his pupil. Cyric stabbed Marek in the back and justified his murder by claiming his former teacher was a Zhent spy.[138]

Cyric and the rest of the adventuring party joined in the defense of Shadowdale as the Zhents marched down from the north. He demonstrated great bravery when he confronted a group of Dalesmen abandoning their duties, and convinced them to help the town's refugees leave for safety by means of the [Ashaba River](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ashaba_River "Ashaba River").[47] During the [battle](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Second_battle_of_Shadowdale "Second battle of Shadowdale"), Cyric led the ambush against the Zhentilar cavalry as the mounted soldiers crossed the Ashaba bridge, and even scored a direct bow shot against the Zhent commander and [Banite](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Banite "Banite") priest [Fzoul Chembryl](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fzoul_Chembryl "Fzoul Chembryl").[139] He was celebrated as a champion of the town by many of the local Dalesfolk.[140]

Unfortunately, Cyric had little time to bask in praise as Midnight and Adon were accused of killing Elminster in a magical explosion in the [Twisted Tower](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Twisted_Tower_of_Ashaba "Twisted Tower of Ashaba") during the battle.[141] The pair were brought before Lord [Mourngrym Amcathra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mourngrym_Amcathra "Mourngrym Amcathra") for judgement and, after a brief trial, were sentenced to death the following day. Cyric had to suppress his instincts to immediately murder Lord Mourngrym,[142]but rather set out that night to free his companions from captivity. Overcome by indifference and bloodlust, Cyric silently slaughtered many unsuspecting guardsmen as he 'rescued' Midnight and the near-catatonic Adon.[131][143] In the dead of night, the trio set out east down the Ashaba _en route_ to Tantras, where one of the _Tablets of Fate_ was rumored to lay in wait.[144]

### The Traitor

During their travel downriver, Cyric's cynicism and dark nature took over. He tormented the troubled Adon and tried to convince Midnight to abandon any hope of reuniting with Kelemvor. By this time, Cyric saw Midnight and the arcane power she demonstrated in the Twisted Tower as his means to acquire the _Tablets of Fate_ for himself.[49] After some time the trio came to [Blackfeather Bridge](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Blackfeather_Bridge_(bridge) "Blackfeather Bridge (bridge)"), atop which stood Kelemvor and a group of Dalesman charged with their apprehension. Cyric panicked, capsized their skiff and plummeted into the waters of the Ashaba.[145] He was recovered by the Dalesmen after a short time and managed to lie and deceive his way into being taken captive rather than immediately killed for his grievous crimes in Shadowdale.[146]

Cyric's time as a prisoner was short-lived, as the Dalesmen were soon stopped by a superiorly outfitted band of Zhentilar soldiers, the Company of the Scorpions. A fight broke out between the two groups and the Zhent company emerged victorious. Cyric expertly maneuvered the subsequent conversation to his advantage and secured himself a spot within the company by killing the last remaining Dalesman in a twisted game.[147] He traveled with the Zhents across the eastern Dalelands for some time,[131] learned more about their history and hierarchy[148] and eventually took over the Company of the Scorpions for his own.[149]

In a short time, Cyric and his company were granted audience with Bane in Scardale. In an ironic twist, Bane's avatar remained in the body of Fzoul Chembryl, the Zhent priest Cyric had wounded during the Battle of Shadowdale.[150] Cyric offered nearly all he knew about his former companions and their quest for the _Tablets of Fate_ to the Dark Lord, but held back offering freely Midnight's true name. Bane tasked Cyric and the assassin Durrock with killing Kelemvor in Tantras, and apprehending Midnight,[150] but unfortunately they proved unsuccessful.[151] The Company of the Scorpions and their leader were designated as Bane's personal guard,[152] protecting him as he received the benefits of a [Myrkulyte](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Myrkulyte "Myrkulyte") ritual that cost the lives of [Bhaal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bhaal "Bhaal")'s assassins across [Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn "Faerûn").[153]

Bane took a new avatar in the form of a towering [obsidian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Obsidian "Obsidian") colossus and marched across the [Dragon Reach](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Reach "Dragon Reach") to Tantras with a fleet of Zhent ships—among them _The Argent_ that passaged Cyric and his company—following closely behind.[154]The colossal Bane was met in battle by the equally mighty avatar of Torm, and the two gods battled until each destroyed the other's mortal form.[155] Sensing his moment to once again gain the upper hand, Cyric ordered his ship away from the dueling gods and avoided the destructive magic Midnight and recently returned Elminster delivered unto Bane's army. The _Argent_ then sailed west in pursuit of Midnight, who had reunited with Kelemvor and Adon.[156] Despite what was written in a [certain book](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cyrinishad "Cyrinishad") that detailed Cyric's life,[157] he had no hand in the god's death but merely survived it by means of treachery.[156]

Cyric and the Company of the Scorpions continued in pursuit of Kelemvor, Midnight, and Adon over the following [tendays](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tenday "Tenday"),[158] determined to retrieve the tablet they'd recovered from Tantras.[100] During that time, the company slaughtered the [halfling](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Halfling "Halfling") village of Black Oaks[159][160] and Cyric obtained _Godsbane_, an intelligent blade inhabited by the god Mask[5] that guided him to give in to his murderous instincts.[161]

### The Godslayer

Having established themselves in the [Haunted Halls](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Haunted_Halls "Haunted Halls") of Cormyr, Cyric's company abandoned all ties to the Zhentarim and dedicated their lives to his quest for the _Tablets of Fate_. During this time, horrific murders appeared across the Heartlands, with all signs pointing to the avatar of Bhaal, the Lord of Murder. Unable to stay in one locale for too long,[162] they continued tracking Midnight and the others until they found refuge in the fortress of [High Horn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/High_Horn_(hold) "High Horn (hold)").[163] When the adventurers left under Cormyrean escort[164] west through Yellow Snake Pass, Cyric saw his moment of opportunity to act.[165] As Cyric as snuck upon their camp, Kelemvor took notice and confronted him, with their former fellow companions, the Cormyrean soldiers, and Cyric's own company looking on. Despite Midnight's protests—and lingering hope Cyric would rejoin their group—Cyric and Kelemvor fought a vicious battle. When Kelemvor took the upper hand and held Cyric at the mercy of his blade, Cyric took advantage of Mystra's sympathy, got out from Kelemvor's grasp, and murdered his their traveling companion [Sneakabout](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sneakabout "Sneakabout"), before fleeing into the night.[166]

Distraught after witnessing Cyric's true cruelty, Midnight went off to confront him alone,[167] but was kidnapped by Bhaal in his most recently claimed avatar.[168] The god of murder confided that only she held the power that could best Helm—despite Mystra's previous failure—and recover the second tablet from the Realm of the Dead.[169] Putting their past aside for a moment, Kelemvor, Adon, and Cyric agreed to work together to rescue Midnight from Bane and rode off to [Boareskyr Bridge](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Boareskyr_Bridge "Boareskyr Bridge"). Fighting alongside each other once again, the former companions wore Bhaal down and Cyric delivered a final killing blow through Bhaal's chest.[131][170][171] A great blast of white energy engulfed the bridge along with everyone atop it.[101]

Cyric awoke to hear his former companions discussing what should be done with him. Ultimately they decided to leave him to his fate and continue on to [Dragonspear Castle](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonspear_Castle "Dragonspear Castle"). Most importantly to Cyric, he retained possession of _Godsbane_.[102] Cyric stalked after the trio as they stole into the ruined castle, struck out at them as they descended into its basement, and—while aiming for Kelemvor—killed Adon with a single shot from his bow. He was turned away by Mystra's magic,[172] and forced to flee west from the castle towards [Daggerford](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Daggerford "Daggerford").[73]

Cyric bided his time and tracked his companions to the city of [Waterdeep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep "Waterdeep") in mid–[Marpenoth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marpenoth "Marpenoth"). He infiltrated the city's [sewer system](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep/Sewers "Waterdeep/Sewers"), and shadowed the avatar of Myrkul to the entrance beneath [Blackstaff Tower](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Blackstaff_Tower "Blackstaff Tower"), where the God of the Dead deposited one of the tablets.[173] He ascended the tower and found Elminster, Midnight, Kelemvor, and a resurrected Adon on the roof, all in possession of both _Tablets of Fate_.[174] As Myrkul's army of the dead descended upon Waterdeep, Cyric gravely wounded Midnight, slew Kelemvor, and took the _tablets_[131][175] to the Celestial Stairway atop [Mount Waterdeep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mount_Waterdeep "Mount Waterdeep"). There Cyric presented himself before Lord Ao, and pled his case to the overgod. He was granted godhood, but could only use it to serve both Ao and his newfound faithful throughout the Realms. Cyric would never again feel any satisfaction or joy, and would forever have to contend with Midnight, the restored incarnation of Mystra and new Goddess of Magic.[87][176]

### The God

> *“Cyric was a mistake, an exception that will not be permitted a second time.”*
— Ao's [solar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Solar "Solar"), to [Amelyssan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Amelyssan "Amelyssan") the Blackhearted.[177]

On [Marpenoth 15](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marpenoth_15 "Marpenoth 15") in 1358 DR, Cyric ascended to godhood,[107] taking on the portfolios of Strife, Murder, and Death,[176] and took on nearly all the worshipers of Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul.[5][24][54]

Some months after his ascension,[105] Cyric conspired with Mask to kill the goddess [Leira](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Leira "Leira").[79] Cyric took over her portfolios of Deception[178] and Illusion,[179] and along with Mask, successfully withheld this information from the rest of the pantheon.[180]

Over the following decade, Cyric ordered his faithful to scour every corner of the Realms to uncover the soul of Kelemvor Lyonsbane.[88] Unbeknownst to Cyric, Kelemvor's eternal being was being hidden away by Mask.[181] At the same time, Cyric directed his clergy to scribe the _[Cyrinishad](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cyrinishad "Cyrinishad")_, a tome that would magically convert anyone that read it or heard it read aloud to Cyric's faith.[182][183][184]

On [Marpenoth 30](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Marpenoth_30 "Marpenoth 30") of [Year of Maidens, 1361 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1361_DR "1361 DR"),[185][note 3] Cyric directed his patriarch in Zhentil Keep to carry out an inquisition against the lingering faithful of Bane in Zhentil Keep, in a series of killings known as the [Banedeath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Banedeath "Banedeath"). Banites in the city were forced to convert to Cyricism to explain to the new God of Strife in person as to why they should be exempt of his worship.[186][187]

### The Cyrinishad

“

It all depends on me, you see. Nothing is certain until I have beheld it and set it in place, until I have placed myself above it or below, before it or after...I am the One, the All, the Face Behind the Mask. I am the Everything.

”

— Cyric, on the [Night of Despair](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Night_of_Despair "Night of Despair"), [Nightal 28](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Nightal_28 "Nightal 28"), [1368 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1368_DR "1368 DR").[7]

In the [Year of the Banner, 1368 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1368_DR "1368 DR"), Cyric attempted to create the _Cyrinishad_himself by means of his magic,[184] but was cut off from the Weave by Mystra.[68] Shortly thereafter Cyric was informed that the spirit of Kelemvor could be found somewhere within the City of Strife, its exact resting place obscured by magic.[188] He immediately ordered the city's denizens to scour the city.[118]With the search underway, Cyric personally commissioned the Zhent scribe [Rinda](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rinda "Rinda"), daughter of [Bevis](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bevis "Bevis") the Illuminator, to pen the _Cyrinishad_ herself.[189][190]He rapidly became frustrated with the fruitless search for Kelemvor, however, and ordered Jergal to completely annihilate one denizen within his realm each hour until it was uncovered.[71]

At the same time Rinda worked with Fzoul Chembryl[191] and the gods Mask and Oghma to craft a second book, _[The True Life of Cyric](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_True_Life_of_Cyric "The True Life of Cyric")_. Used in place of the _Cyrinishad_, _The True Life_ would demonstrate to Cyric's faithful just how deranged and treacherous he actually was.[189][183][126]

Cyric focused all his attention on the Mortal Realms and ignored his denizens, leading to growing unrest in the City of Strife.[74] He then initiated an inquisition against the heretical Bane-worshipers in cities across the Moonsea.[192] Armed with powerful [Gondar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gond "Gond") suits of armor,[188] Cyric's inquisitors began in Zhentil Keep,[183][193][194] and continued the slaughter throughout Darkhold, [Mulmaster](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mulmaster "Mulmaster"), [Teshwave](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Teshwave "Teshwave"), [Yûlash](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Y%C3%BBlash "Yûlash"), and the [Citadel of the Raven](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel_of_the_Raven "Citadel of the Raven").[90][195] This slaughter later came to be known as the Second Banedeath.[196]

After his success with the inquisition, Cyric manipulated the god Oghma into sharing the rites to a bloody [Gargauthan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gargauth "Gargauth") ritual that could grant insight to the whereabouts of Kelemvor's soul.[89] He presented the rites before his patriarch [Xeno Mirrormane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Xeno_Mirrormane "Xeno Mirrormane") in dramatic fashion and forced his faithful to prepare for its performance.[197] Cyric then raised an army of [dragons](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon "Dragon") and frost giants from [Thar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thar "Thar") to the north and directed them to march south in an invasion of Zhentil Keep,[198] with the intent of saving the city and emerging as its savior.[183]Finally, Cyric retrieved the final draft of the _Cyrinishad_ from Rinda, and revealed that he was aware of her treachery and took the book for himself. He compelled Fzoul Chembryl to read from the tome and then murder the young scribe. Unbeknownst to Cyric, Mask had taken Fzoul's mortal form, faked Rinda's death, and together they were poised share _The True Life of Cyric_ with all the god's faithful. However one complication remained:[157] Mask's reading of the _Cyrinishad_ lessened his divine power to that of a demigod, transferred to Cyric his dominion over intrigue,[199] and left him believing Cyric was the one true god of the Realms.[199] The _Cyrinishad_ worked on deities just as it would with mortals.[157]

Mystra garnered support from the Circle to stop Cyric's abuse of dark magic, turned his former inquisitors against him, and spurred full rebellion in the City of Strife.[183][200] Fzoul Chembryl completed the reading of _The True Life of Cyric_ in Zhentil Keep,[189][201] inciting riots in the city[7] just as Cyric's monstrous armies [broke though its northern walls](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fall_of_Zhentil_Keep "Fall of Zhentil Keep")[202] and ran rampant through its streets.[203]Cyric returned to witness the denizens storming the Bone Castle.[93] While Cyric was weakened and his faith waned across the Realms, Mask revealed himself as _Godsbane_ and professed his 'revelation' of Cyric's singular divinity.[7] In response, Cyric broke his beloved weapon in two and greatly weakened Mask.[204] Kelemvor arrived to lead the denizens to the throne room of the Bone Castle,[7] ran Cyric through with the broken blade half of _Godsbane_, and threw Cyric's diminished body to the Burning Men.[205] The City of Strife's denizens elevated Kelemvor as the new God of the Dead,[206] transferring a major part of Cyric's divine power to his most hated foe.[204][207]

### The Crucible

“

As for Cyric, now he sits alone in his Shattered Keep, lost in delusions of grandeur and absolute power, leaving his church of Faerûn to grow ever more fragmented and weak... Cyric was the first to read the _Cyrinishad_; his own lies drove him mad.

”

— Excerpt from _The True Life of Cyric_.[208][209]

After his defeat, Cyric reappeared in the plane of Pandemonium where he constructed his new realm,[210] the [Supreme Throne](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Supreme_Throne "Supreme Throne").[5] Having read from the _Cyrinishad_ himself Cyric was driven entirely mad.[26] He believed himself superior to the entirety of the pantheon,[210] with power that rivaled that of the overgod Ao.[8] In truth he was left with greatly diminished divine power, and only held onto the portfolios of Intrigue, Murder, and Strife.[211]

In the [Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1369_DR "1369 DR"), Cyric briefly appeared within the [Pocket Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Pocket_Plane "Pocket Plane") that manifested from the divine realm of Bhaal. Cyric spoke with one of the last remaining [Bhaalspawn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bhaalspawn "Bhaalspawn"), [Abdel Adrian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abdel_Adrian "Abdel Adrian"), to assess how much a threat he posed of ascending as the God of Murder. Cyric appeared to be aware of the madness he held, but remained civil and did not stray from Ao's decree that he not interfere with the [Bhaalspawn crisis](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bhaalspawn_crisis "Bhaalspawn crisis").[59]

Over the next couple years Cyric abandoned his divine responsibilities and peace and serenity spread across much of the Realms. By the [Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1371_DR "1371 DR"), this became apparent to even the gods and [Tempus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tempus "Tempus")' ire grew. The god of war was eventually convinced by Mask[211] to formally accuse Cyric of neglecting his faithful and disrupting [the Balance](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Balance "The Balance"). Cyric was brought before the Circle of Twelve and Tyr officially charged him with being innocent by reason of insanity.[8][212] On the eve of the trial, Cyric commanded his loyal follower [Malik el Sami](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Malik_el_Sami "Malik el Sami") to recover the lost _Cyrinishad_ from [Candlekeep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Candlekeep "Candlekeep"), so that he might read it before the other gods at the trial and inflict upon them the same delusion it had on Mask.[157][9]

During the initial stages of Cyric's trial, the former God of the Dead turned attention to his accusers. He alleged that Mystra did not allow [morally upstanding](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Good "Good") individuals to die by means of magic and that Kelemvor offered such great rewards to the virtuous after death that they no longer feared their own mortality.[213] Tyr decreed that the charges of incompetence and disrupting the Balance against Cyric would be linked to those put forth against Mystra and Kelemvor.[214]

In the city of [Elversult](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elversult "Elversult"), Adon, now Mystra's new patriarch, was performing last rites when he became became possessed by a force appearing to be linked to Cyric.[215] In truth, it was Mask forcing Adon[216] to view Mystra as Cyric did, and the mortal priest was driven mad in the process.[217] Mask carried out this plot in an attempt to take back his portfolio from Cyric,[218] and compel Mystra to withhold magic from Cyric's followers.[219] Meanwhile, Malik el Sami continued on towards Zhentil Keep, determined to cure Cyric of his madness, by once again replacing the _Cyrinishad_ with _The True Life_.[220]

To prevent Mystra from interfering with Malik's quest, Cyric manipulated Mystra into attacking Mask, and she was temporarily interred within Helm's prison.[221]After Mystra was released, she visited Kelemvor in his newly formed [Crystal Spire](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Crystal_Spire "Crystal Spire") in the City of the Dead. Mystra came to witness the dramatic change that Kelemvor had undergone: Cyric's machinations had forced the new God of the Dead—who remained as her longtime lover—to disregard the morality of his subjects. While wholly dedicated to his new divine duties, Kelemvor became cold, indifferent, and passionless. He was no longer the man or god Mystra fell in love with.[222]

At the trial, each of the accused gods presented their cases before the Circle of Twelve. Kelemvor demonstrated his newfound commitment to fair and neutral judgement of the dead, and Mystra offered a similar revelation, that she would no longer unjustly wield access to the Weave to suit her own desires. When time came for Cyric to offer his defense—by having Malik read from the _Cyrinishad_—some members of the Circle intervened and chaos broke out. Malik was allowed by Tyr to present his god's defense, and dutifully acted in Cyric's best interests by reading from _The True Life_. The process was excruciating for Cyric but by the end of Malik's recitation, the Mad God had recovered his senses and offered his final defense: even when in the throes of madness he was the only one worthy to be the God of Strife. Through all his plotting and scheming Cyric had finally managed to strip Kelemvor and Midnight of their passions and destroy the love they shared. The same love that incited feelings of jealousy and rejection in Cyric,[85][49] and led to him break the vows of friendship in his quest for ultimate power,[100][131][175] was reduced to twin teardrops that swirled around his [silver chalice](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cyric#Possessions "Cyric"). Cyric was found guilty and allowed to remain as the God of Strife, with Mystra herself casting the final vote in his favor.[212][72]

Freed from his madness, Cyric and Malik pursued a plot to chronicle their time together and unite the fractured Cyricist faith.[223] This new tome that would document and glorify Cyric's feats would be entitled: _An Honest and True Account of the Trial of Cyric the Mad, or How Our Dark Lord Saved Faerûn (Again)_. Cyric demanded that this book be published before a sect of [Waterdhavian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdhavian "Waterdhavian") [Oghmanytes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Oghmanyte "Oghmanyte") published their own accounting of the events.[224]

As Cyric's insanity led to his decline in power, Bane's immortal son Iyachtu Xvim was able to take back some of his father's lost portfolios from the Mad God, including Hatred and Tyranny.[225]

### The Prisoner

“

The white queen is troubled by can't say why. The black queen hates the white and gives the assassin a black cloak. The assassin steals up on the white queen. She can't see him gliding through the shadows. The sword screams. The white queen falls. Her city falls.

”

In the [Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1373_DR "1373 DR"), a new and more capable champion of Cyric named [Zasian Menz](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zasian_Menz "Zasian Menz") arose to carry out his will throughout the Realms. Zasian managed to open a pathway to [Celestia](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Celestia "Celestia") from the [City of Brass](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/City_of_Brass "City of Brass"),[226] a plot that claimed twelve years of the priest's life.[227] In the years that followed, Cyric forged an alliance with the goddess [Shar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shar "Shar"), working together to weaken Mystra's hold over the Weave and lessen her influence in the Realms.[95]

Over a decade later, in the [Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1384_DR "1384 DR"), Cyric unleashed his wrath on Helm by orchestrating his death at the hands of Tyr.[228]

The [following year](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1385_DR "1385 DR"), Cyric's priest Zasian freed the Sharran 'shadow mystic' [Kashada](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kashada "Kashada") from imprisonment in Celestia.[229] Kashada was in fact an aspect of the goddess Shar, the Goddess of Night.[230] Shar had manipulated Cyric's Zasian to help her supplant the Weave with her own [Shadow Weave](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Weave "Shadow Weave").[231] Cyric himself accompanied Shar to the Hall of Petitions,[232] and Shar distracted the god Azuth long enough for Cyric to recover his arcane staff. Cyric used Azuth's _[Old Staff](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Staff "Old Staff")_ to finally murder Mystra, and exacted revenge upon his former companion and one-time friend.[233] Mystra's death wrecked the bonds that held together the Weave, and brought about the Spellplague,[231][234] a calamitous event that was felt across the multiverse.[235][78] Once again, Cyric broke the heart of someone dearest to Mystra, her former lover and longtime confidant Elminster.[236]

In retaliation for his murder of Mystra, [Lathander](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lathander "Lathander"), Tyr, and Sune trapped Cyric in the Supreme Throne for 1000 years.[78][97] It was believed by some that Cyric foresaw his own imprisonment and formulated a plot to forge a key that would grant his escape.[237] This did not come to pass however, and Cyric's power continually waned over the next century. The worship of Bane flourished in its place,[238] as the faith of the Black Lord became the state religion in the realm of [Thay](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thay "Thay").[239][240]

Cyric would not appear in the mortal Realms for over a century, and even then only as a mere manifestation. In the [Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1486_DR "1486 DR"), during the world-shaping [Second Sundering](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Sundering "Second Sundering"), Cyric ordered his long-faithful servant and newly designated chosen Malik to foil Shar's faithful from securing the _[Eye of Gruumsh](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Gruumsh "Eye of Gruumsh")_ to initiate the [Cycle of Night](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cycle_of_Night "Cycle of Night") on Toril. While Malik and his companions—chosen of Helm, Sune, and [Siamorphe](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Siamorphe "Siamorphe")—ventured through the [Chondalwood](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chondalwood "Chondalwood"), Cyric manifested before Malik as the visage of a skull in a dead tree. The imprisoned god ordered Malik to slay his fellows at their exact moment of triumph.[66]

## Rumors & Legends

A small group of scholars of the Realms theorized that Ao possessed advanced knowledge of Cyric's ascension to godhood.[185]

The play entitled _The Curious Tale of Wisteria Vale_ supposed there was a very old crystal touched by Cyric that could turn others to commit [evil](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Evil "Evil") deeds.[241]

It was speculated that the divine Cyric finally acquired the _Ring of Winter_ he originally sought after in Thar as a mortal.[242]

Though there was no proof, rumors circulated among the gods that Cyric killed [Hoar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hoar "Hoar"),[243] claimed a portion of [Waukeen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waukeen "Waukeen")'s divine power following her disappearance in the Time of Troubles,[244] and played a part the slaying of Helm by Tyr decades later.[78] The allegation regarding Waukeen's divinity was false,[245] whereas Cyric's involvement in Helms's death was confirmed as truth.[228]

After Cyric's imprisonment, it was alleged that there were seven black [iron](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Iron "Iron") keys that could be used to free him from the shackles of the Supreme Throne. Such keys fetched prices upwards of 50,000 [gp](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gp "Gp").[11]

According to the doctrine of the [Tormtar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tormtar "Tormtar") church, the God of Duty would sacrifice himself in a ultimate battle between the gods, one that would save the Realms from ever again falling victim to Cyric's influence.[246]
