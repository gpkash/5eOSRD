The **Knights of Holy Judgment** were an order of [[paladin|paladins]] that faithfully focused on the lawful tenets of their patron deity [[Tyr]].

## Activities
The Knights were very close to the [[5eOSRD/Worlds/Forgotten Realms/Prime Material Plane/Realmspace/Deities/Tyr/Knights of the Merciful Sword]], both of whose members were the only faithful of [[Tyr]] who were eligible to join the ranks of the [[Hammers of Grimjaws]].

Much of their energy was devoted to hunting criminals and monsters in order to bring them to justice. In fact, they specialized in the hunting of devils.

Some of the elite members of the Knights of Holy Judgment might receive an invitation to join the [[Hammers of Grimjaws]].
