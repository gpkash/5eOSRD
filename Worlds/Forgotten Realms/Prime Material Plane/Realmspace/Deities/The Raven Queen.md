# The Raven Queen

The Raven Queen is the current ruler of the Shadowfell and a goddess of death. She originates from the Feywilds where she lived as a mortal and a queen of the elves. She sought greater power though and attempted to ascend to godhood but her ritual was corrupted and she was almost killed. To save herself, she drew memories from the Shadowfell to maintain her presence. She continues to rule from the Shadowfell over her shadar-kai followers, seeking to wrap herself in more memories to continue to gain in power.
