**Velsharoon** (pronounced: _VEL-shah-roon_), also known as **Mellifleur**, was the [Faerunian](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBnian_pantheon "Faerûnian pantheon") [demigod](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Demigod "Demigod") of [necromancy](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Necromancy "Necromancy"), the patron of [liches](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lich "Lich") and those that explored [undeath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Undeath "Undeath"). Arrogant and obsessed, the **Archmage of Necromancy**continued his experiments on the living and the dead as a god, paying no heed to the lesser lives lost in the name of his research and encouraging his disciples to do the same.

## Description

Velsharoon appeared as a gaunt, sallow-skinned man 10 feet (3 meters) in height, his deathly cold flesh stretched thin over his bones, and whose thin and graying hair flowed across his back in a snarl. He dressed in purple, worm-ridden, moth-eaten robes, with a tarnished silver crown on his head. His eyes were pitch black pits with tiny green flames moving malevolently within.

### Manifestations

Velsharoon's favored manifestation was a burning skull, wreathed in red, pale blue or blue-green flames. He was fond of using various gemstones to denote his favor or presence of hues including black, purple, maroon, rust-red, gray, and a bright and unnatural green reminiscent of [green slimes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Green_slime "Green slime"). The sudden appearance of a [bloodrose](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bloodrose "Bloodrose") was said to herald him.

## Personality

As a god, Velsharoon was canny, yet extremely vain and selfish, concerned overmuch with revenge and experimenting on both living and dead. This was not a great change from the mortal he was.

## Possessions

In his humanoid form, Velsharoon wielded the _[Skull Staff of the Necromancer](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Skull_Staff_of_the_Necromancer "Skull Staff of the Necromancer")_.

## Divine Realm

Velsharoon had his [divine realm](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_realm "Divine realm") called Death's Embrace on [Mungoth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mungoth "Mungoth"), the third mount of [Gehenna](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gehenna "Gehenna") in the [Great Wheel cosmology](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Wheel_cosmology "Great Wheel cosmology"). In the [World Tree cosmology](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/World_Tree_cosmology "World Tree cosmology") it lay on the magical plane of [Dweomerheart](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dweomerheart "Dweomerheart"), far underground beneath [Azuth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Azuth_(realm) "Azuth (realm)") and [The Eye](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Eye "The Eye"). In appearance a moldy tomb, Death's Embrace was a repository of all necromantic knowledge.

## Relationships

Although he nominally served [Azuth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Azuth "Azuth") (and through him, [Mystra](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mystra "Mystra")), Velsharoon re-established a secret alliance with [Talos](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Talos "Talos") and a flirtatious relationship with [Shar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shar "Shar").

He became an ally of [Kiaransalee](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kiaransalee "Kiaransalee"), and a foe of [Jergal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Jergal "Jergal"), [Sehanine Moonbow](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sehanine_Moonbow "Sehanine Moonbow") and [Urogalan](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Urogalan "Urogalan").

After the [Second Sundering](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Sundering "Second Sundering"), Velsharoon was believed to think little of [Myrkul](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Myrkul "Myrkul"), considering him a do-nothing has-been, with Myrkul returning a symmetrical sentiment for the grasping upstart.

### The Church

## History

As a Red Wizard of Thay, Velsharoon fought a [spell](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spell "Spell")-battle to a draw against [Omm Hlandrar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Omm_Hlandrar "Omm Hlandrar") of [Halruaa](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Halruaa "Halruaa") in the skies over the [Shaar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shaar "Shaar") in the [Year of the Sacrificed Fortune, 827 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/827_DR "827 DR").

Once, Velsharoon had sought the position of [Zulkir](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zulkir "Zulkir") of [Necromancy](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Necromancy "Necromancy"), but he feuded with several other Red Wizards, including his chief rival, [Szass Tam](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Szass_Tam "Szass Tam"), who saw him driven out of Thay. Thereafter, he was known as a renegade wizard of Thay, and one of the most powerful archmages in the Realms by the mid–14th century [DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/DR "DR"). At that time, he was known to be a foe to Omm Hlandrar, [Halder](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Halder "Halder") of [Delzimmer](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Delzimmer "Delzimmer"), [Elminster](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elminster "Elminster"), [the Simbul](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/The_Simbul "The Simbul"), and Mempter. The former four had challenged Velsharoon in his wicked plots. In turn, the arch-necromancer worked to acquire enough power to destroy those who'd opposed him.

In the [Plains of Purple Dust](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Plains_of_Purple_Dust "Plains of Purple Dust"), he had discovered a process to achieve demigodhood through a potion which called for the blood of adventurers. In the late 1350s DR, those archmages who'd opposed him feared for their safety and for the safety and stability of the Realms. The infamy of his actions had traveled so far, that he was heard of in the [Moonshaes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moonshaes "Moonshaes") even. The process had been devised by the god [Talos](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Talos "Talos"), who needed a new demigod. This culminated with his lichdom and then ascension in the year [1368 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1368_DR "1368 DR"). As a god, he was granted [Cyric](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cyric "Cyric")'s portfolio over necromancy; sages speculated this was to counterbalance [Kelemvor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kelemvor "Kelemvor")'s dislike for the undead. His fame grew in divinity, becoming known to [Khelben Arunsun](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Khelben_Arunsun "Khelben Arunsun").

However, his service to Talos required him to expend his divine energy far too quickly, and he soon turned his allegiance to [Azuth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Azuth "Azuth"). He later made a secret alliance of convenience with Talos, using his servants' undead servants to spread chaos and destruction; he was not liked by either of his masters, because of this. He also began flirting with [Shar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shar "Shar"). He ultimately lost his divine realm to the [Spellplague](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Spellplague "Spellplague") in [1385 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1385_DR "1385 DR").

He was destroyed by the Simbul in [1425 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1425_DR "1425 DR"), leaving behind his charred body, which was watched in [Aglarond](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aglarond "Aglarond") since. However, his cult was still alive and had access to divine spells within [Mulmaster](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mulmaster "Mulmaster") after the [Second Sundering](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Sundering "Second Sundering"), indicating he may have been restored by [Ao](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ao "Ao") during the event.

## Rumors

His influence was felt in the [1090 DR](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/1090_DR "1090 DR"), in the place that would later become the [Battle of Bones](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Bones "Battle of Bones"), where a floating, flame-wreathed skull was seen during the last skirmish in the war, though he wouldn't become a divinity until later. Whether the symbol foretold his ascension or was adopted upon his embrace was not known.

The Simbul was said to have sacrificed herself to destroy the god's corpse in the [Astral Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Plane "Astral Plane").
