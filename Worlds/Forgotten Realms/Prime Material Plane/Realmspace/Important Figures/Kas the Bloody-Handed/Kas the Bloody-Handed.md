# Kas the Bloody-Handed

The most trusted lieutenant of [[Vecna]], right up until he killed him, Kas the Bloody-Handed is an imposing figure indeed.

The Archlich [[Vecna]] may be one of the setting’s most memorable villains. Powerful, utterly evil, and dangerous, one has to wonder, what would it take to betray this despotic [[5eOSRD/Bestiary/Lich|lich]]? The answer lies in the bloodied hands of Kas the Destroyer. Also known as Kas the Bloody-Handed. Kas is an example of just how far the pure-hearted can fall when they succumb to the temptations of evil.

[[Vampire]]. Knight. Slayer of gods. This was Kas the Bloody-Handed.

### Kas the Bloody-Handed Early Life

Kas began life as a [[human]]. A [[paladin]] of Tycheron, a region now known as the Dyyvers on Oerth. Little else is known about his earliest days before running into the archlich. Some say he had already forsaken his oaths. That he had a lust for battle and blood that could not be quenched. Others say it was [[Vecna]] himself who turned Kas. All that is known is that the story of Kas the Bloody-Handed begins in earnest in his service to [[Vecna]].

Kas the Bloody-Handed proved himself in service to the arch-[[5eOSRD/Bestiary/Lich|lich]]. He aided [[Vecna]] in his quest to conquer much of Oerth. [[Vecna]] established an ever growing empire that swept from the northwestern shores of the Azure Sea to the Crystalmists mountains. Kas is said to have helped subdue Ulek, the Grand March, and Geoff.

As [[Vecna]]’s physical form weakened, Kas became his instrument of rule. Though [[Vecna]]’s power never waned, the [[5eOSRD/Bestiary/Lich|lich]] was focused on godhood, and left the affairs of his kingdoms to Kas.

In the absence of [[Vecna]], Kas pronounced his lord’s judgements. He presided over the Council in [[Vecna]]’s name, and led his armies across Oerth. And for a time, he served loyally.

### The Vampire Known As Kas

At some point, [[Vecna]] rewarded Kas for his loyal service. He made the loathsome man a dark figure, gifted with the power of undeath. Kas’ transformation imbued him with fell power, as he became a greater [[Vampire]]. But even this was not enough of a gift. [[Vecna]] forged for Kas a sword of great evil: the _Sword of Kas_. An artifact powerful enough to be [[Vecna]]’s will in the world.

Ironically enough, the sword would be the instrument of [[Vecna]]’s destruction. Kas sat in his master’s stead, doing the hard work of maintaining the empire. And the sword saw all. It watched as Kas grew in prowess, and sought to tempt its master into greater power still.

Whispering sweetly venomous flatteries, the sword made Kas realize he was the true ruler of these lands. After all, what did [[Vecna]] do? He was a name. A power, yes, but an idle one. An absent one.

### Kas the Dark Lord

It didn’t take much for the sword to seduce Kas. And in time, emboldened by the sword’s sweet voice, Kas struck at his lord. No one living remains who saw the battle. But the results were catastrophic. [[Vecna]]’s dark tower crumbled into the dust as the two titans of evil fought. All that remained were the sword and [[Vecna]]’s left hand and eye, cut out from their master by the Sword of Kas.

This great betrayal destroyed [[Vecna]], for a time. It also saw Kas get swept into the mists of Ravenloft. There he became a Dark Lord of Ravenloft. He was imprisoned in the land known as Tovag. There he ruled with a twisted sense of honor, challenging those who seem powerful. But his thirst for blood was ever unquenched. There he remains. Imprisoned, battling, and tormented.
