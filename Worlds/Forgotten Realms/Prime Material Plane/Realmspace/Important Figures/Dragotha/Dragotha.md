# Dragotha

![[Dragotha.webp]]

**Dragotha** is a powerful undead dragon known as a dracolich. He was formerly a powerful red dragon, the mightiest consort of [[5eOSRD/Bestiary/Tiamat/Tiamat]]. At some point Dragotha offended his mistress, and was forced to leave Avernus. Making his way to [[Oerth]], Dragotha fell in with [[Kyuss]], and eventually became a dracolich and Kyuss' greatest servant. Dragotha's lair is thought to lie in the [Wormcrawl Fissure](https://greyhawk.fandom.com/wiki/Wormcrawl_Fissure "Wormcrawl Fissure"), near [Rift Canyon](https://greyhawk.fandom.com/wiki/Rift_Canyon "Rift Canyon").

According to this history, Dragotha was forced into quiescence (inactivity) by Keraptis, the infamous [[wizard]] using a magical device called the Crown of Mortality.

An expedition to Dragotha's lair is told in the song "The Claws of Dragotha", which is believed to have been penned sometime in the 5th century CY
