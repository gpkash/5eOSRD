# Sorrowsworn

The Shadowfell is an unkind place, to those that wander its wastes. Melancholy and despair sit heavy in the air, ready to sink deep into a heart that lingers too long; amplifying and twisting a creature's suffering until it consumes them utterly. Such unfortunates are warped into new and terrible forms, persisting only for the sake of sharing their wretchedness with others.
