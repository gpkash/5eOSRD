# Shadowfell

***DM tips:***
> The Shadowfell is a brutal, desolate, perverted inversion of the material plane, and both the environment and denizens reflect that. The trees are all rotten and lifeless, displaying a muggy gray bark and twisted broken limbs. The water is murky and unclean, nigh undrinkable without the purify food and water spell. The sky is dimly illuminated by a faint grey light which breaks through the clouds and strange, flying, potentially dangerous creatures are silhouetted against the overcast. Any notable landmarks are jagged and twisted (mountains, towers, etc.) and the air reeks of death while cold winds chill the characters to the bone.
> 
> Most who reside in the Shadowfell are depressed and hopeless, long since suffering from Shadowfell Despair (read the DMG section on the Shadowfell), and those who aren't are selfishly trying to elevate themselves to a position of power in the realm. You often find them in plain drab clothes, or dressed in tattered rags if they've been there long enough. Gaunt merchants will try to peddle their overpriced goods to the party, be it supplies or slaves and if turned down the merchants will call the party cheapskates and move on. Some folks will have unfortunately stumbled into the Shadowfell from the material plane, so it's important to try and play those sympathy cards with the party by having them state things like "Please I just want to go home..." and begging the party to help them get out.

## Despair Tables

Have your players roll a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure their character is affected by the Shadowfell Despair. Roll a d6 to determine the type of Despair, as shown on the table to the right, then a d8 on the matching table below to determine the effect.

Despair effects stack. After finishing a long rest, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to end all Despair effects. Calm Emotions or a magical effect that removes curses can end the Despair early.

### Despair Type

| d6  | Type and Flaw                                                                                                    |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3 | Apathy. The character gains the following flaw: “I don’t believe I can make a difference to anyone or anything.” |
| 4-5 | Dread. The character gains the following flaw: “I am convinced that this place is going to kill me.”             |
| 6   | Madness. The character gains the following flaw: “I can’t tell what’s real anymore.”                             |

*Encourage players to roleplay the ‘mood’ given below as much as their new flaw.*
