# Shieldmeet
This holiday is a day that occurs after [[Midsummer]] and before [[Eleasias]]. It occurs once every 4 years on the leap year.

**Shieldmeet** was the equivalent of a leap year day in the [[Calendar of Harptos]], occurring once every four years, adding a day after the festival of [[Midsummer]] and before 1st of [[Eleasias]]. Traditionally the day was used for fairs, bazaars, musical and theatrical performances, and tournaments of skill and magical ability. Nobles usually held court to hear the petitions of their people and to make or renew trade pacts, alliances, and agreements.

Shieldmeet was known as _**Cinnaelos'Cor**_, "the Day of Corellon's Peace" in elvish and marked the end of an _aeloulaev_ and the beginning of a new one in the elven[[Aryselmalyn calendar]].

## Shieldmeet Years
