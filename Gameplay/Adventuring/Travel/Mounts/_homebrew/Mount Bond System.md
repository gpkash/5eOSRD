# Mount Bond System

For those looking for deeper role-play when players have a mount, the DM may want to employ the bond system. This system allows players to feel an appropriate burden when using mounts and be able to rewarded for treating their mounts with respect. 

## Bond

The bond is a modifier number between -6 and +6 that players keep track of and is used as a modifier to the player's [[Animal Handling]] checks with their mount. 

Bond scores begin at +0 but the DM may choose to start the bond higher or lower depending on the circumstances of acquiring the mount.


| Modifier | Bond                                                                                          |
|:--------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    +6    | You and your mount have an exemplary bond, they will trust your every command.                |
|    +5    | Your connection is steadfast and they have become a trusting companion.                       |
|    +4    | Your mount is reliable and has confidence that you will treat them well.                      |
|    +3    | You feel a strong connection, your mount remains calm and composed in most situations.        |
|    +2    | Your mount is reliable and willing, they respond to your cues with obedience and cooperation. |
|    +1    | There's a growing bond, your mount is friendly and cooperative.                               |
|    +0    | Your mount's demeanor is neutral and they rely on behaving how they were trained.             |
|    -1    | A sense of apathy lingers in the bond, your mount appears indifferent and listless.           |
|    -2    | The bond feels weak, your mount is distant and reserved, lacking emotional connection.        |
|    -3    | A strained connection is evident, your mount seems anxious and skittish.                      |
|    -4    | The bond is fragile and you feel that you cannot trust it will do as you ask.                 |
|    -5    | A tenuous bond remains and your mount is unpredictable.                                       |
|    -6    | The bond is severed and, unless forced, it doesn't comply with what you ask of it.            | 

The bond modifier is added to any [[animal handling]] rolls the player must make when trying to coerce their mount to do something they might not normally do. For example, if a player would like their horse to jump over a fence the DM may ask the player roll an [[Animal Handling]] skill check. Players with a strong (positive) bond with the their mount are more like to succeed than those who hold a weak (negative) bond.

## Increasing the Bond
Bond increases cannot exceed more than 2 times / day. At the DMs discretion, the following actions will increase the bond by 1:
- Feeding the mount their favourite food
- A successful [[Animal Handling]] check
- A natural 20 [[Animal Handling]] check
- Tending to the mount (petting, brushing, talking)

## Decreasing the Bond
Unlike increases, any number of bond decreases can occur in a day. At the DMs discretion, the following will decrease a player's bond with their mount by 1:
- Damage to the mount while in the player's charge
- Player failed an [[Animal Handling]] check but forces their mount to do it anyway
- Not feeding their mount or providing it something to drink at least once / day
- Overworking their mount
- A natural 1 [[Animal Handling]] check

Although the bond cannot go lower than -6. At the moment a -6 bond takes another "decrease", the mount goes into flight/flight mode and attempts to escape. Otherwise, an untethered mount at -5 or less will wander off and not return.
