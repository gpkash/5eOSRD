# Resting

While Dungeons & Dragons puts a significant emphasis on combat, exploration, and interacting with NPCs, no matter how experienced and skilled an adventuring party may be, every adventurer needs to make sure they get enough rest. D&D is filled with a wide range of mechanics and **resting** is among the most common and important activities for any party at both low and high levels to partake in. 

However, as there are two different types of rest that adventurers can take in Dungeons & Dragons that each has their own benefits, we're going to explore everything that new players need to know about taking rests in D&D. 

## What Is Resting? 

As the name would imply, **resting is when a party of adventurers takes some time to unwind and relax**. Whether a party is setting up a brief perimeter to take a breather in a dungeon, setting up camp in the wilderness, taking a break to drink at a tavern, or even just staying the night at an inn, each of these activities can potentially result in the benefits of a rest. 

There are **two types of rests** that players need to know about that offer different benefits: **short rests** and **long rests**. 

## What Is A Short Rest? 

Often easy to squeeze in after a difficult battle or in the midst of a day of travel, a**short rest is an hour** of relaxation in which a party can pass around stories, eat and drink, tend to their wounds, and replenish energy that may have been exerted earlier in the day. 

Much less time-consuming than a long rest, one of the defining elements of a short rest is that **players may spend any number of their hit die**. 

Each time a character finishes an uninterrupted short rest, they may roll any number of their hit die (a character has a number of hit die equal to their level), **regaining that much HP**. This allows short rests to often function as a safe means of quickly allowing a party to regain lost health after a grueling fight. 

Additionally, it's important to note that **there are several classes that are capable of regaining uses of some of their key class features by simply completing a short rest** rather than a long rest. 

Most notably, unlike other spellcasters, **Warlocks** are capable of regaining each of their **spell slots** by simply completing a short rest, while **Fighters** regain their ability to use their **Action Surge** feature by concluding a **short rest** . 

When traveling with a party member of either of these classes, it's a good idea to make sure that the party takes advantage of short rests to help their allies recharge. 

## What Is A Long Rest? 

Unlike a one-hour short rest that serves as a break from adventuring, **a long rest takes eight hours**, most often representing a party's **need to sleep**. Long rests are quite integral at the end of every day, as **nearly every class feature and racial feature in the game with limited uses is fully recharged when a creature concludes a long rest**. 

In addition to allowing creatures to regain their resources, creatures notably **regain all of their lost hit points and regain all of their hit dice upon concluding a long rest**, making them an integral part of staying alive. 

While these eight hours can technically be interrupted, creatures don't gain the benefits of a long rest if over one total hour is spent performing any kind of strenuous activity. This means that when camping, party members can alternate night watch shifts whilst still gaining the benefits of such a rest. 

## What Happens If You Don't Rest? 

As one could expect, if a creature goes extended periods of time without resting, sleep deprivation and fatigue will take their toll. Whenever 24 hours pass in which a character has not completed a long rest, they must make a **DC 10 Constitution saving throw**. If this saving throw is failed, that creature gains **one level of exhaustion**. 

If a creature continues to go several days without taking long rests, **the DC of this constitution Save is increased by +5 for each day that character hasn't rested.** As exhaustion not only debilitates a character but can also be fatal, this is something that any adventurer would be wise to avoid. 

## Alternatives To Resting 

While it's nearly impossible to completely cut off a character's need to rest, there are some ways in which characters can speed up the resting process and combat the exhaustion that comes with skimping on sleep. 

Firstly, due to their **Trance** ability, **Elves** are a race that can notably gain the benefits of a long rest in a mere **four hours, rather than eight,** making them a solid choice for those determined to cut your resting time in half. 

Additionally, for those looking to speed up the time it takes to short rest, the **Catnap spell** available to **Artificers, Bards, Sorcerers, and Wizards** allows up to three creatures to gain the full benefits of a short rest in only ten minutes, making it an excellent asset in a part featuring a **Warlock and/or Fighter.**

While we don't advise that adventurers skip their long rests, in dire situations in which a party truly can't stop to sleep, rendering them exhausted, the **Greater Restoration spell** can be used to reduce a creature's exhaustion by one level.
