## Drinking game

The competitors can ask between 4 types of different beverages. These four drinks are ordered by the amount of alcohol they have. The stronger (or alcohol-heavy) they are, the higher the DC of the Constitution Saving Throw they will have to make against getting drunk. Try to give the four of them a different name to make it sound more realistic. As an example, you can use this format:

- **“Light-hearted”** (DC10), worth 1 point
- **“Bull’s blood”** (DC14), worth 2 points
- **“Frosty heart”** (DC17), worth 3 points
- **“Carnage”** (DC20), worth 4 points

The objective is to reach 20 points without falling unconscious or throwing up. Depending on which drink you choose the number of points you get for making the Saving Throw. Every time you fail a save, you gain a penalty that will make it harder for you to win, while also leaving you one step ahead to falling unconscious. Even if you fail the save, the points are still granted to you.

- **1st fail:** -2 to Saving Throws.
- **2nd fail:** -2 to Saving Throws, disadvantage in Saving Throws and Poisoned condition.
- **3rd fail:** Unconscious condition or the drinker throws up.

Those with advantage in Saving Throws against getting poisoned also get advantage in these saving throws. If the character is a usual drinker (a pirate for example), you as a DM can choose to give a bonus to its saves ranging from a +1 to a +3.

The complexity of this minigame lies in the fact that choosing stronger drinks highly increases your chance of falling unconscious, but of winning at the same time. If the players decide to go safely by always choosing the lighter drinks, make their opponent choose the toughest ones to create more tension. The fact that even failing the saves give you the points can be used strategically.

Feel free to change the save DCs, names of the drinks and points needed to win as much as you like to make the game more interesting for your table.
