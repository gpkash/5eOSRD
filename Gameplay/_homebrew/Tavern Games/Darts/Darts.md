# Darts Tavern Game

In the most simple case, a series of opposed DEX (**Athletics**) checks will suffice. However, I ended up with a play group that were Dart enthusiast and wanted a full on mini-game. So I’m sharing the simple rules I used in hopes it might have some use in your sessions.

## The Rules

A player rolls 2 separate color D20s, the first represents the segment of the board, the second the ring. Like normal darts the segment the dart lands in (the number rolled on the die) determines the score. If you’re not familiar with darts, see the diagram below and it should make sense. The final score for the throw is modified by the result of the ring die like so.

Ring Die:

| d20   | result                  |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| 10-13 | double the segment roll |
| 14-17 | triple the segment roll | 
| 18-19 | outer bullseye (25pt)   |
| 20+   | inner bullseye (50pt)   |

The player may split their ranged attack modifier between the ring and score rolls.

### Example

Beau takes a turn at darts, rolls an 8 on the segment die, and a 13 on the ring die. They choose to user their 7 ranged attack bonus to add 3 to the segment die to make it a 12, and 2 to the ring die to make it a 15. That’s an Inner Bullseye for 25 pts!

## Conclusion

This level of mini-game isn’t for everyone, but groups looking to play out some downtime may enjoy it. The system is simple enough to play out, but isn’t intended to be a balance game on it’s own. It works best when players move along quickly, perhaps with a favorite libation, and make quick choices. So keep it moving and have them create some character moments. Now get out there and run some great games.
