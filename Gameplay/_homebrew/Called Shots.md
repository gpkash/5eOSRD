When a a creature attempts to attack on specific area of a target (such as legs, eyes or sword-arm) a **called shot** occurs. The exact area targeted depends on the anatomy of the monster, but some equivalent to the following should exist for even the most outlandish creatures. 

## Rules
- The attacking creature has disadvantage on the attack roll.
- On a successful hit, the attack deals normal damage and an additional effects is applied based on the area targeted (see below).
- These effects last until the end of the attacking creature's next turn. A creature cannot make a called shot if they have any other type of disadvantage imposed on them (even if it is canceled out by advantage).

## Special effects
### Legs or Wings
If the attack hits, the target has its movement speed reduced by 10 feet. If the creature is flying, the attacking creature can additionally cause it to fall up to 10 feet straight down. 

### Eyes
If the attack hits, the target has disadvantage on the next Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check it makes. In addition, the next creature the target attacks benefits from half cover against that attack. 

### Armor
If the attack hits, the target's weakest point is temporarily exposed the next attack roll against it has advantage. 

###  Weapon
If the attack hits, the target is thrown off balance or out of position; its next attack roll has disadvantage. Successive called shots against this same area can impose disadvantage on the second attack roll it makes and so on. 

### Vitals
If the attack hits, the target takes additional damage equal to the
attacker's proficiency bonus.
