## Plunge Attack / Drop Attack

While falling onto a creature you make a Melee Weapon Attack against it. On a hit, you deal the weapon's damage plus additional damage equal to 1d6 for every 10 feet you fell, and you take half the normal falling damage. The additional damage is the same type as the weapon.
