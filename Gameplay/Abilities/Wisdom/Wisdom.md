### Wisdom

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

#### Wisdom Checks

A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

- [[Animal Handling]]
- [[Insight]]

- [[Survival]]

***Other Wisdom Checks***. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
- Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

#### Spellcasting Ability

Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
