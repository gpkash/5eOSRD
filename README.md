# Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (pre-2024): Obsidian SRD

The 5eOSRD is for Game Masters *(and those special ultra-organized players)* for use in and out of sessions. It is a reference that brings together the most relevant parts of The Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, the supplemental guides and some of the most popular homebrew content. 

The goals of this project is to support you to:
1. Run ultra-smooth sessions by having all of the official rules at your fingertips.
2. Levelling up your organization by having the ability to link SRD content to both your campaign documents and session notes.
